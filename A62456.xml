            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO ALL Chriſtian Readers.</head>
            <p>I Have heard that, in the time of our Late Troubles, the Presbyterians were put to <hi>nonplus</hi> by the Fanatickes; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of them a ground in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for a <hi>National</hi> Church. I let paſs that miſtake of both parties, which the term of <hi>National</hi> involveth. For, the ſtate of the Queſtion muſt needs concern that part of the Church, which every reſpective Sovereignty containeth. Now, one Sovereignty may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeveral Nations: As there are two in this Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> But wee need not marvel, that they could give no anſwer to a demand, which their own Title allowed them no ground to anſwer. Had they believed the, Creed (which they thruſt out of the Church) and that Article of it, which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>one Catholick Church,</hi> they might have had an anſwer to it; But ſuch a one, as would have deſtroyed the pretenſe of their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. For, were the Unity of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:48725:3"/> which that Article profeſſeth, meerly Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with God, by Communion in his Spirit, the Uſurpers of Sovereign Power might make Presbyteries Churches, by as good a Title, as that by which they make themſelves Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. But the Unity which that Article pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth is Viſible; with that Church, which is, or ought to bee always one and the ſame, from our Lord and his Apoſtles; (by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Offices of Gods Service, eſpecially the Euchariſt) to diſtinguiſh it from Haereſies and Schiſmes, whom the Title of Catholick viſibly diſtinguiſheth from the Church. That Title the Presbyteries cannot pretend to; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as viſible, that their authority is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Long Parliament, and their own conſent, as it is viſible, that the authority of the Whole Church is derived from our Lord and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>For, the Unity of the Church is not derived from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but from our Lord and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the Law impoſed by them upon all Chriſtians, to maintain Communion among themſelves, upon thoſe terms, which the Common Chriſtianity, ſuppoſed in the ſaid Communion, may allow; Whereby the Church is Viſible, by being Catholick. It is manifeſt
<pb facs="tcp:48725:3"/> by what Title, and therefore, upon what terms, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> firſt in the Empire, and after him all Chriſtian Powers in their reſpective Sovereignties, doe make Religion a Law to their Subjects. For, being to bee baptized, and made a member of the Church, by the act of the Church; If all Chriſtians, by their Baptiſme, do conſecrate themſelves to the ſervice of God in his Church, then muſt hee alſo, by being baptized, conſecrate the Power of the Empire to the maintenance of that Chriſtianity into which hee was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; part whereof, is the Unity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. And, as the effect of this obligation is viſible, in bringing the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church; So is it a viſible advantage for the Church, that the profeſſion thereof is a Law to Chriſtian States, by the rewards and penalties, whereby it is inacted. For, when all are conſtrained to bee Chriſtians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land, ſo much the more will bee Chriſtians, according to the Laws of God, and of his Church. And as it is evident that, without ſuch Laws, Unity in Religion will not prevail in the World, which cannot prevail with the help of them: No leſs manifeſt is it, that, without Unity, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb facs="tcp:48725:4"/> will ſoon come to nothing. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the decay, which a little time of diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath viſibly made, in the Chriſtianity of this Kingdom, is paſt cure by reaſoning, if he queſtion this conſequence.</p>
            <p>This is that Principle, which muſt juſtifie the Reformation which wee profeſs, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the due bounds, and terms, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it. This is that, which muſt reunite the parties, which hitherto are at diſtance, if wee will have them united, to the purpoſe of ſaving ſouls, out of ſatisfaction in the Laws which they are to execute; not only to the purpoſe of publick peace, for hope or fear of the rewards and penalties, which they are inacted with. This is that which muſt ſecure the Conſcience of the Kingdom, that thoſe rewards and penalties will bee allowed, as for the ſervice of God, at the great day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, how much this concerns the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, now that Religion is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed, by the Law of the Land; it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enough. Let the Presbyterians ſubmit to the due terms, upon which, the Fanaticks may be acknowleged members of this Church; as acknowleging the Covenant of Baptiſme, for the condition of holding the State of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:48725:4"/> Grace; and the Recuſants ſhall ſtand bound to own the Faith of this Church, for the Faith of the Catholick Church. Let the Laws of this Church bee Ruled by the Laws of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, in thoſe times, which, hee that owneth one Catholick Church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, cannot diſown; and all ſhall appear bound to bee of this Church, as viſibly the ſame Church with that which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For, the Church is Viſible by the Laws of it. And therefore, if the Laws bee the ſame, the Church is viſibly the ſame: And all that are not of it, ſhall bee evidently liable to ſuch penalties, as belong to them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey thoſe Laws of their Country, which the common Chriſtianity requireth.</p>
            <p>Let no man then marvel, that being, ſetled in this opinion, upon all the conſideration, which our long diſtractions have allowed me time to take; I am not afraid to publiſh this brief view of it; referring my ſelf, for proof of the particulars, to that which I have publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore. Let it not ſeem ſtrange, that I deliver it, ſome times, with that reſolution and aſſurance, which ſeems to admit no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to it. For, though the Faith of Gods Church bee always the ſame; yet I profeſs of
<pb facs="tcp:48725:5"/> my ſelf, that the Laws of this Church are to bee Ruled by the Laws of the primitive Church; with that allowance, which the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the preſent time, and that ſtate of Chriſtianity which it hath introduced, from that which then was, may require. And, by profeſſing this, I do really, (and not only for a formality) ſubmit my ſelf to the authority of Superiors, as well as to the judgment and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of every Chriſtian. For, how far the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times are capable of thoſe Rules, which all times are to go by, that would bee one and the ſame Church, with that which was from the beginning; I take not upon me to judge, as belonging to the account of Superiors. Nay, before I have done, you ſhall ſee, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe my Opinion it ſelf, (and not only my own proceeding, according, or not contrary to it) to the authority of Superiors, and to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgement. And therefore, let it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to plead for the improving of the Laws of this Church, ſo long as it is lawful to plead for the aboliſhing of the Laws of this Kingdom. For, as it is manifeſt, that our Eccleſiaſtical Laws are the Laws of the Kingdom: So would I not open my mouth for improving them, were it not to make them the Laws of Gods only true Church.</p>

If the Pope bee Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no true Church. If no Viſible Church, then no ſin of Schiſme. Antichriſt may bee an Idolater, but cannot bee the Head of a Church. Though it were Idolatry to worſhip the Hoſt, yet, to kneel at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion would bee Holy. That which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is not Idolatry, if it bee a true Church.

Immoderate charges vain on both ſides. The charge of Schiſme on both ſides moderate, as to the Church. The ſin of Schiſme, as to God, horrible.

                  <hi>Eraſtians</hi> can acknowledge no Viſible Church founded by God. Their opinion inableth Sovereigns to perſecute Gods truth by Gods Law. Perſecuting the truth is the uſe of a Power which no Sovereign can have.

                  <p>If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bee a true Church, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is the restoring of that which hath been. If the Pope be Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no true Church. If no Viſible Church, then no ſinne of Schiſme. Antichriſt may bee an Idolater, but cannot be the Head of a Church. Though it were Idolatry to worſhip the Hoſt, yet, to kneele at the Communion would bee Holy. That which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth is not Idolatry, if it bee a true Church. They that ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Idolaters are thereby Schiſmatickes before God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce the time that I could underſtand the Diſpute about<note place="margin">If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bee a true Church, Reformation is the reſtoring of that which hath been.</note> Religion, when it was demanded, on the behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Where was your Church before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> time? The Anſwer hath always been; Even where it is now. The anſwer was; That it is the ſame Church that it was;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48725:10"/> A Church which was ſick, and is now cured; Which was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and now is cleared of her Corruptions. This anſwer ſuppoſeth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church, when that Change, which wee call Reformation, was made. And therefore granteth, (as it hath always been granted) that ſo it is at preſent. For it cannot bee queſtioned, that it is the ſame Church now which then it was; Though the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> may have encreaſed the corruption of it. And upon theſe terms, all diſpute of choice in Religion comes to trial upon this iſſue; Whether the change that is made hath reſtored that which was in the beginning, or not. An iſſue not to be tried, but by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to trial, upon the particulars in which the change conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>But are wee all content to goe to tryal upon this iſſue? It<note place="margin">If the Pope bee Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no true Church.</note> were good that wee did underſtand one another, whether wee bee agreed upon it or not. For if wee bee, then may wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to build <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, without any noiſe If not, wee ſhall bee the Builders of <hi>Babel;</hi> Wee ſhall never underſtand one anothers Language. For, of a truth, there is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alleged for the breach between us and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> to wit, that the Pope is Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters. If this pretenſe bee true, wee need not ſeek farther for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſtance. Wee are to owne the Separation for our own Act, and to glorie in it. For it is done by Gods expreſſe Command; <hi>Come out of her my People;</hi> As to the Jewes, in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo to the Chriſtians, in the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> If it bee the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> there ſignifieth. But if this plea bee good, it may bee inconſiſtent with that which the former plea ſuppoſeth. And though wee cannot goe to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al upon the truth of it, without going to trial upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in difference; Yet it is neceſſary to provide, that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict not our ſelves.

For if the Viſible Unity of the Church be not founded by God, then is there no crime of Schiſme in breaking that Unity; But onely of Hereſy, in breaking it upon an errour in the Faith. If there bee ſuch an Unity; And therefore ſuch a crime in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; Care would bee had, that wee ground not our ſelves, in this ſtate of Separation, upon that which will render us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to it.</p>

II <hi>John</hi> 7. ſignifies nothing elſe by that name, but thoſe whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calls <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> Mat. XXIV. 24. <hi>Mark</hi> XIII. 22. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee that pretendeth to bee ſuch a Prophet and a Prince, as the Jewes expected that their Chriſt ſhould bee, in oppoſition to the true Chriſt in whom Chriſtians beleeve; As hee is a <hi>falſe Chriſt,</hi> ſo is hee <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For, there is no other mention of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in all the Scriptures, but this. Other Scriptures are onely ſuppoſed to ſpeak of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But preſumption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evidence, muſt not bee taken for truth. I do not doubt then, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is really <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> Though the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans expected no Chriſt. Becauſe hee is the author of a Law, which they take for Gods Law: And of a power founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Impoſture; As the Jewes expect that their Chriſt ſhall reſtore <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and the power which God firſt founded upon it. But neither can the Jewes Antichriſt, nor the Mahumetans Antichriſt bee Idolaters, without rooting up the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which was not the way to win, either the Jewes, or thoſe whom Mahomet had to do with. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I believe <hi>Manicheus</hi> was Antichriſt and an Idolater
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48725:11"/> both. I believe he taught the Idolatry of the Perſians, in his two Gods; the principles, one of good, the other of evil. He pretended, indeed, to come from Chriſt, as having his Spirit; And therefore ſent out his twelve Apoſtles, as our Lord Chriſt had ſent his. But yet, that he brought in his own new Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſtianity, no man that knows his poſitions can doubt. And is not hee Antichriſt, that pretends to do what Chriſt indeed hath done? Therefore, I deny not, that the Pope may bee Antichriſt, though the Papiſts bee Idolaters. But I do not grant, that the Pope can bee Antichriſt, granting the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee a true Church. For, to bee a ttue Church preſuppoſes the profeſſion of ſo much Chriſtianity, as is neceſſary to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians. But the ſalvation of no Chriſtian can ſtand with the profeſſion of a falſe Chriſt. And therefore, granting the Pope to be Antichriſt, they that own him can bee no Church. So, this plea will bee inconſiſtent with the former, which ſuppoſeth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a true Church, when the Separation fell out.</p>
               <p>As for the charge of Idolatry, it is at preſent alleged in Bar<note place="margin">Though it were Idolatry to worſhip the Hoſt, yet, to kneel at the Communion would be Holy.</note> to the Law of this Kingdom, and the effect of it, that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Hoſt in the Papacy is Idolatry; Therefore wee muſt not receive the Communion kneeling, if wee would bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for breaking the Brazen Serpent, with <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> I ſay nothing to the conſequence, though it were eaſie enough to ſay; That the people committed Idolatry to the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent till that very day, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 4. And to allege the Practice of the Catholick Church; Who, while there was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of offenſe, did not make uſe of Idol Temples for Churches: But, when the offenſe began to ceaſe; As in the time of <hi>Honorius;</hi> common reaſon obliged them to do it. Let them purſue the conſequence of their own reaſon; That is, let them mete by their own Standard; and then they muſt pull down all the Churches in the Kingdom. I ſhall prefer the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom this Nation received Chriſtianity; Ordering the Pagan Feſtivals of our Anceſtors, to bee converted to the Aſſemblies of Chriſtians. For, if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſanctifie not all times, places, and geſtures, that may pretend, in common reaſon, to advance the ſervice of God; Wherein differeth it from Judaiſine? For in Judaiſme, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48725:11"/> day, the place, the circumſtance preſcribed by the Law, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that action to bee the ſervice of God, which, it had been abominable to tender God for his ſervice, at another time, or in another place, or otherwiſe. As reſt on the ſeventh day of the Week, dwelling in a Booth at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, was the ſervice of God, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But to pretend to ſerve God thereby at another time, had been to uſurpe upon God, and his power which gave the Law. On the contrary, the ſervice of God according to Chriſtianity, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth all times, all places, all geſtures, all circumſtances, that can pretend to expreſs, to procure, to advance that attention of mind, that devotion of ſpirit, wherewith Chriſtians profeſs to worſhip God, in ſpirit and truth. Otherwiſe, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God muſt conſiſt in making a difference of meats and drinks, in deſpite of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (And, for the ſame reaſon, of times, and places, and geſtures) not for unity in the ſervice of God, or increaſe of devotion, as all reaſon requireth; But as the Subject matter, wherein, the ſervice of God, according to Chriſtianity, conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>But I ſet aſide this conſequence; though I could not let it<note place="margin">That which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth is not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, if it bee a true Church.</note> paſs without ſetting this mark upon it. The aſſumption who will undertake to prove? Who will take upon him to ſhew us, that the worſhip of the Hoſt in the Papacy is Idolatry? They who grant the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee a true Church, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to bee had in it, and by it, may, if they ſee cauſe, ſpare contradicting thoſe that take it for granted before it bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; But they cannot take it for granted themſelves. A Church is a company of Chriſtians; And all Chriſtians profeſs the true Chriſt: And all that profeſs the true Chriſt profeſs the true God; And, profeſſing the true God, if they believe that which they profeſs, they cannot honour any creature as they honour God: For they profeſs that there is only one true God: And that there is infinite diſtance between him and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo that they cannot eſteem any creature to bee God; And therefore they cannot ſo honour any creature, as if it were God. Chriſtianity ſuppoſeth the belief of one true God, and the being of the Church ſuppoſeth Chriſtianity. It took away Idolatry, in point of Fact, which Judaiſme could not do, though it ſhewed reaſon enough to take it away. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48725:12"/> let no man think it eaſie for a Church, to build up that, (either by expreſs Law, or by ſilent Cuſtom) which, the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon which it is built deſtroyeth. Let us bee as careful as you pleaſe, that Idolatry, which is put out at the great gate of the Church, get in at no back-door of it. The true God of Iſrael, and our Lord Chriſt, might bee Idols to them that profeſſed not one true God. If they who profeſs the true Chriſt can bee bred in ſuch ignorance, as not to acknowledg the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his creature, all their Religion may come to bee Idolatry in Gods ſight, however the Church bee obliged to eſteem it. For certainly, ſome Witches commit Idolatry to the Devil, though there bee Witches of all Religions. And ſo there may bee Idolaters of all Religions, ſuppoſing that men may act contrary to that which they profeſs. But that is not the queſtion which wee have in hand, when wee Diſpute; Whether wee are to forſake the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Idolaters, or not. For it is the publique profeſſion thereof, that wee are to forſake: Wee are not to forſake it, for the actions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, contrary to that which they publiquely profeſs. Now, they which profeſs the only true Chriſt, and therefore, the only true God, do neceſſarily profeſs to deteſt all Idolatry; which, the profeſſion of Chriſtianity effectively rooted out of the World, whereſoever it prevailed. And ſo doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill as ſeriouſly profeſs, as they who charge them to bee Idolaters. And therefore, cannot eaſily bee convinced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Idolatry. For, without expreſsly renouncing this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they cannot expreſsly bee Idolaters: without renouncing it by ſuch conſequence, as may convince common reaſon that they contradict themſelves, and renounce all of them, that which all of them profeſs, they cannot bee Idolaters by conſequence. And therefore, it is not eaſie to make it appear to common reaſon that they are Idolaters; (And ſo, that wee are to forſake them as Idolaters) becauſe then it muſt appear to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo great a part of Chriſtendom doth, by their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, contradict that which themſelves profeſs.<note place="margin">They that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are thereby Schiſmatickes before God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And what will they that ſtand upon this plea ſay to me, who pretend to have proved, that the nature of Idolatry conſiſteth in that which I have ſaid; And therefore, that the Papiſts are not, by their Common profeſſion, Idolaters? Can they pretend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48725:12"/> ſo much charity to me, as to have attempted the anſwering of my Reaſons, and the rectifying of my miſtakes. Or will they ſhew me who hath anſwered them; and ſo, that they need not be troubled for me? If they will not bee tied to this, would they have the Law of the Land changed, upon a ſuppoſition which I have deſtroyed, and they cannot pretend to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored? Nay, would they have it changed to no better effect, then to make me, and all that are ſatisfied with the Reaſons which I have advanced, Schiſmaticks in the ſight of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and conſenting to the change that ſhall be made for their ſake? This were indeed an incomparable piece of charity, to purchaſe peace and unity with them, at the charge of anſwering for all the miſchiefes which our Schiſme with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> produceth. For in plain terms, we make our ſelves Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks by grounding our Reformation upon this pretenſe. For on the one ſide, wee profeſs the Separation to have been our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, not a conſequence of the Reformation, by the fault of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in not complying with it. Becauſe wee give ſuch a Reaſon for it, as if be true, wee cannot, without renouncing our Chriſtianity, hold communion with thoſe whom wee charge with it. Whereas Reformation is indeed, and alwayes was the thing intended. Diviſion in the Church, which it hath occaſioned, is the crime of thoſe that refuſe to come in to it, upon ſuch terms as the common Chriſtianity requireth. On the other ſide, this cauſe; which would bee more then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to juſtifie Separation, did it appear to be true; Charges the miſchiefes of the Schiſme upon thoſe that proceed upon it, before it be as evident as the miſchiefes are, which they run into upon it. So that, ſhould this Church declare, that the change which wee call Reformation is grounded upon this ſuppoſition; I muſt then acknowledg that wee are the Schiſmaticks. For, the cauſe not appearing to me, (as hitherto it hath not, and I think, will never be made to appear to me) the ſeparation, and the miſchiefes of it, muſt be imputed to them that make the change. And as they who juſtifie the Reformation by charging the Pope to bee Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters; So, on the other ſide, they who overcharge the Reformation to bee Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, make themſelves thereby Schiſmatickes before God.</p>

What the Romiſh Miſſionaries get by the charge of Haereſie, and the pretenſe of Infallibility. What we get by the charge of Idolatry and Antichriſt. Immoderate charges vaine on both ſides. The charge of Schiſme on both ſides moderate, as to the Church. The ſin of Schiſme, as to God, horrible.

For, this being clear beyond Diſpute, what do wee gain by a ſuppoſition, ſo impoſſible to bee ſet in the light of competent evidence? Even that which wee ſee is come to paſs; An unchriſtian, rather then an unreaſonable apprehenſion; That, the further wee run from them, the neerer wee ſhall come to the truth of Chriſtianity. Whereas, wee are to take no leſs heed, that wee run not beyond the Church of God; The Unity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48725:13"/> whereof, if it bee indeed ordained by God, is ordained to no other purpoſe, then to render the true bounds of Chriſtianity (that is, the means of ſalvation) viſible to all Chriſtians. For, the truth of the particulars in difference ſtands where it would ſtand, whether the Pope bee Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or not. But, they that believe them ſo, muſt needs thereupon incline to believe them further from the truth, then indeed they will appear to bee, if it bee not true. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs have a hand in the Schiſme, in departing further from them then they ought to do. He that takes the Pope for Antichriſt, and the Papiſts for Idolaters, can never <hi>weigh by his own Weights, and mete by his own Meaſures,</hi> till he hate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts worſe then Jewes or Mahumetans, who cannot be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which ſome, but few of them, profeſs to do. Is not he, that runs from <hi>Rome</hi> with this Opinion, in danger to forget the Proverb; <hi>Ita fugias ne praeter caſam;</hi> and run by the door of Gods Church?</p>
               <p>Now, ſuppoſe wee can have no Communion with the Church<note place="margin">The ſuppoſition of one Viſible Church the ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as well within the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as in the whole Church.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it appeareth that the Pope is Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters; Yet ought wee to hold Communion with all Chriſtendom beſides, that own not Antichriſt, nor his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries. I ſay, if the Viſible Unity of the Church appear to bee the Ordinance of God; in the next place to holding the truth of Chriſtianity, we ſhall ſtand obliged to hold Communion with the reſt of the Church. But this Communion cannot bee maintained, without an expreſs profeſſion, that the Viſible U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church is the expreſs will of God, and his Ordinance; though the will of man render it fruſtrate. This profeſſion it is, that obligeth all, to ſtand to thoſe grounds, and thoſe term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, as they have all proved incurable, for want of this Principle of Unity; So it is not poſſible that ours, which have come to paſs in the laſt place, ſhould be cured upon any other principle of Chriſtianity, to the ſalvation of ſouls; however the benefit of publique peace may prevail, to keep them from doing that miſchief in the World, which they have done.</p>

But they that would have the Pope Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters, have revyed it upon them, and taken their Revenge beyond the bounds of blameleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe. For, the profeſſion of Idolatry neceſſarily ſignifies utter Apoſtaſie from Chriſtianity to Paganiſme. There is nothing elſe known by the name of Idolatry in the Scriptures; By which they muſt prove, if they do prove them Idolaters. For, the Idolatry of the Gnoſtickes (which, I am confident, is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in divers Texts of the New Teſtament) may well bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the Idolatry of the Pagans, though pretending to bee Chriſtians. Becauſe they did not ſtick to exerciſe the ſame Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with the Pagans, when occaſion was offered; though they had their own Idolatries beſides; whether peculiar to their ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, or as Magicians. This is the reaſon of that which I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that wee need not Diſpute, which ſide is the true Church, if wee can prove them Idolaters. But it is to be feared, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Miſſionaries do advantage themſelves more by the pretenſe of Haereſie, then they by the pretenſe of Idolatry, or Antichriſt. For, having obtained this great truth, that there is no ſalvation out of Gods Church: and then, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Gods Church; (which, as I ſaid in the beginning, hath always been granted) how eaſie is it to infer; That there is no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For, how many of them whom they deal with can diſtinguiſh <hi>a Church</hi> from <hi>the Church;</hi> or give a Reaſon how; God having founded one Church; it may nevertheleſs ſtand ſo divided, that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be had on both ſides? Which Reaſon being once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, the Infallibility of the preſent Church is ſwallowed <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and all the Decrees of the Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Trent</hi> muſt down, with the ſame aſſurance as the H. Trinity. Nor need you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between Haereſie and Schiſme, when once the Church ſhall have pronounced. Thus ſave they the labour of proving <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory,</hi> Prayers to Saints, <hi>Latine Service,</hi> the <hi>half Communion,</hi> and other points of difference; all of them too tough to bee overcome. All of them are clearly gained, by the prejudice which men have impoſed upon themſelves, that the Church which enjoyns them cannot erre. Whereas nothing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48725:14"/> can bee more evident then that which I propoſed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; That it cannot be tryed which ſide is the true Church, but by going to tryal upon the particulars in difference.</p>
               <p>But they who charge the Pope to be Antichriſt, and the Papiſts<note place="margin">What wee get by the charge of Idolatry and Antichriſt.</note> Idolaters, the higher their charge, the more to do muſt they have to perſwade common reaſon, that ſo great a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould expect to beſaved, by profeſſing to contradict that which themſelves profeſs. And, ſuppoſe that a prejudicate zeal can tranſport a man, to think the wiſeſt people upon earth (thoſe that Govern the See of <hi>Rome</hi>) and all thoſe whom their wiſdom carries along, ſo far out of their wits, as to contradict, by their profeſſion, that which themſelves profeſs. When all this is done, every Text of the Scripture, that cannot bee expounded to this ſuppoſition, will bee a peremptory bar to their pretenſe. And, how much is there of the Apocalypſe it ſelf, that is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not to bee fulfilled, as yet, in that ſenſe? how much of the reſt of the Scripture, that cannot, without violence, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to it? And when a Novice, grounded upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is forced from his ground, upon Remonſtrance of ſuch Reaſons; How ready is he to fall into the ſnare of the Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Whether or not this be the reaſon of that which wiſe men have obſerved; that the paſſage from the one extream to the other is more eaſie and frequent amongſt us, then from the mean to the extream; let men of diſcretion judge. Let not them lead the people by the Noſe, to believe that they can prove their ſuppoſition when they cannot; and then expect that it be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by them that own the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for a true Church; And therefore muſt contradict themſelves if they maintain it.</p>
               <p>It is then <hi>Achitophels</hi> Counſail that hath prevailed on both<note place="margin">Immoderate charges vaine on both ſides.</note> ſides. For make the quarrel irreconcileable, and nothing but Conqueſt muſt end it. But what joy have they of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on either ſide? In all troubles of Chriſtendom ſince <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> time, what gaping hath there been for the ſack of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the downfall of the Pope, upon a Propheſie, ten for one more probably fullfilled, in the ſack of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> many hundred years ago? And all the Civil blood, all that abominable deſolation in Religion which wee have ſeen, our late Uſurper ſeemeth to have accompted meer godlineſs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that work, which God had deſigned him for; as he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48725:15"/> thought himſelf inſpired to believe. Nay, did not ſome of the Reformation prick up their ears, and begin to think well of his Chriſtianity, for that works ſake? And yet this expectation hath not been more vain, then the deep deſignes of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to reduce the Reformation to the obedience thereof by conqueſt, do now, after a long tryal, appear deſperate for the future. Now, if the parties be willing to abate of their charges, as they have reaſon to do, there is a way for both to come off with credit. For the charge of Haereſie naturally ſhrinks into the Meaſure of Schiſme, whenſoever they ſhall be pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves. And they ſeem to do it; at leaſt as many of them, as now inſiſt upon the charge of Schiſme. Let our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple follow their example, and extend the Idolatry they charge them with to all Superſtition; And I will undertake to find them Idolaters in all profeſſions; Namely, all thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry to their own imaginations.</p>
               <p>As for the mutual imputation of Schiſme, it is a civil and a<note place="margin">The charge of Schiſme on both ſides, moderate, as to the Church.</note> moderate challenge, in compariſon of thoſe. For, Schiſme is nothing but civil War in the Church. And in civil Wars, as in all Wars, though it be rather impoſſible then difficult, to name a War that ſhall be juſt on both ſides; yet it is eaſie to find a War that is unjuſt on both ſides. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the ſaying of one in his time, that declaimed upon the Rape of <hi>Lucrece; Mira res,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>duo fuerunt &amp; Adulterium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>us commiſit;</hi> A ſtrange thing, that a man lying with a woman, only the one ſhould commit Adultery. I will not compare War with Adultery; which carries ſin in the name of it. For I will not ſay that all War is ſin. But he that can look upon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, either of civil War in the World, or of Schiſme in the Church, with the heart of a Chriſtian, will not think ſtrange that both ſides ſhould bee Schiſmaticks to God, though only one part can bee Schiſmaticks to the Church. For when the cauſe may bee viſibly decided (as in the Schiſme of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts) then the one ſide are Schiſmaticks, the other is the Church. But when it cannot, (as perhaps it will prove, between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) then if the blame of the Schiſme fall on both ſides, both ſides ſhall bee Schiſmaticks to God, neither to the Church.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48725:15"/>
               <p>But, though I make it a moderate charge, as to the Church,<note place="margin">The ſinne of Schiſme, as to God, horrible.</note> when one ſide challenges the other to bee Schiſmaticks; Yet, as to God, the ſin of Schiſme is of an horrible tincture. For an Haeretick, or an Apoſtate, in the ſight of God, deſtroys only his own ſoul. But he that cauſeth diviſion in the Church, either peremptorily deſtroys, or probably hinders the ſalvation of all that are parties to it. So the Authors of Schiſme muſt anſwer for all the ſouls that periſh by it. How the means of ſalvation depend upon the Unity of the Church; is a thing that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by proving that God hath ordained it for that purpoſe. But if ſo it prove, then may every man ſee, how heavy a charge the crime of Schiſme will prove in Gods ſight. The miſchief of Haereſie will lye in the Schiſme which it involveth, when Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falls out upon a point of Faith. Now, breach of charity, in hindring the ſalvation of all that divide, is abundantly enough to deſtroy ſalvation; though more then enough, if upon a point of Faith, which is Haereſie to the Church.</p>
               <p>But he that would conſider firſt, how much the exceſſive<note place="margin">The Schiſme of the Donatiſts in charging the Catholickes to bee Apoſtates.</note> charges on both ſides contribute to the Diviſion of the Church; then, how much the Diviſion of the Church to the ruine of Chriſtianity; Let him compare our preſent diviſions with the Schiſme of the Donatiſts; the caſe whereof is thus to bee ſtated. It was pretended, that <hi>Caecilianus</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> by Traytors and Apoſtates. For, thoſe that were called <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores</hi> for delivering the Scriptures, and other Utenſils of Gods ſervice, to their perſecutors for preſent ſafety, they accompted no leſs then Apoſtates, for betraying the common Chriſtianity. And that upon this Accompt. If <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees</hi> had redeemed their lives, by eating Swines Fleſh, their crime had not been the bare breach of that Precept; It had been Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ie; becauſe done at the inſtance of him that preſſed them to forſake the Law. So, the Crime of thoſe that delivered ſuch goods to Perſecutors, they juſtly took to bee the Crime of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtafie, as done at the inſtance of Perſecutors, that preſſed all to depart from Chriſtianity. And, when the reſt of the Church did acknowledg <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and communicate with him as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> then did they openly forſake the whole Church, as guilty of the ſame Apoſtaſie, for communicating with Apoſtates, and rejecting them, becauſe they rejected Apoſtates. And had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48725:16"/> they not reaſon on their ſide, if the Church of <hi>Africk,</hi> under <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> had been really Apoſtates? Admitting the Viſible Unity of the Church, it is not to bee avoided. For, this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt bee founded upon ſuppoſition of Chriſtianity. If Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity bee evidently renounced, they who acknowledg mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Apoſtates members of Gods one Church, muſt bee accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Apoſtates themſelves, by them that would indeed bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. But there was great difference between profeſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, and the crime of thoſe, who, diſſembling their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to ſave their lives, had been permitted to hold their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Church; profeſſing it as well as the beſt when the danger was paſt. For, though the Rule of the Church allowed not that they ſhould hold their degrees in the Church; yet it was found neceſſary to abate of the Rule, that Unity (for which the Rule was provided) might bee preſerved. And, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to hold their degrees in the Church for that reaſon, there was difference enough between them and Apoſtates. All this ſuppoſing the matter of Fact; That thoſe who ordained <hi>Caecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> were indeed ſuch as had given up ſuch goods; Which, if it were true, never appeared to the Church to bee true. Whereas they who began the Schiſme, by ordaining another Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> againſt him; were divers ways convicted to bee ſuch themſelves.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange to conſider, how the Donatiſts abhorred the<note place="margin">The ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Schiſme.</note> Catholicks, meerly upon this ſuppoſition, without any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of difference, either in Faith, or in the Rites and Cuſtoms of the Church. For, it is the ground why they rebaptized all thoſe whom they ſeduced from the Catholique Church; as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Apoſtates. Whereas the Catholiques, taking them for Schiſmaticks as they were, ſought only to win them upon ſuch terms, as the reconciling of Schiſmaticks to the Church requires. But it is hard to relate the ſlanders, the murthers, the violences, the miſchiefes, which this Diviſion brought forth; And that, ſo far as I can underſtand, till Chriſtianity was utterly deſtroyed in <hi>Africk</hi> by the Mahumetans.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>They that hold by One Viſible Church are to own the conſequences of it. Nothing to bee chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but upon that ground. Wee cannot bee the ſame Church with that which was, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Though that which ſhall bee ſetled will find advocates. Civil Lawes of Religion to bee changed, till this Rule bee attained. The beginning and riſe of our differences. The preſent ſtate of them. What terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the Presbyterians, wee ought to allow. The Lawes of the Primitive Church the Standard of all change. Our preſent Caſe is not the Caſe of our Forefathers. The Acts of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. no Acts of our Forefathers in Religion. Imperfection of Lawes, in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no imputation to our Forefathers. The pretenſe of tender Conſciences is no Rule. It ſerves Papists, as well as Puritans.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL this while, you ſee, I take it not for granted, that<note place="margin">They that hold by One Viſible Church are to own the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> it is one Viſible Church which our Creed profeſſeth. But I ſay, thoſe who take it for granted, and admit not the due conſequence of it, are they that <hi>weigh not by their own Weights, nor mete by their own Meaſures;</hi> but keep a <hi>Weight and a Weight; a Meaſure and a Meaſure;</hi> which muſt needs bee a thing accurſed, becauſe they cannot both bee the Weights
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48725:17"/> and Meaſures of the Sanctuary. The order of Biſhops, and the right of the Church goods have both recovered their poſſeſſions, by the Law of this Land. In both theſe points, the Law of this Land acknowledgeth the authority of the whole Church of Chriſt; the evidence whereof is indiſputable in both Titles. They that are not content to go by the ſame Weight and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, both with Papiſts and Puritans, in all other matters, they muſt anſwer God, for weighing and meaſuring by their own Weights and Meaſures in other things, weighing and meaſuring by his Weights and Meaſures in theſe.</p>
               <p>The reſt of our differences ſeem to conſiſt in two points; the<note place="margin">Nothing to bee changed, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground.</note> one; concerning the Covenant of Grace, and the dependences of it; ſeems to be of great conſequence to the ſubſtance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. The other muſt comprehend all the noiſe that is made, of Ceremonies, and Formes of Praying, and Power of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and in fine, all that is queſtioned concerning the Lawes of this Church. Theſe are Punctillios indeed, one by one, but all together they make a great ſum. And, take them one by one, it is conſiderable, that the changing of any one is the changing of a Law of this Kingdom. But if the change ſhould bee made, without providing for the ſubſtance of our Chriſtianity, in that which is notoriouſly queſtionable amongſt us; then muſt wee think of a new Anſwer to the Papiſts demand, where was your Church before <hi>Luthers</hi> time? And in all caſes, if the Lawes of our Church bee changed for peace ſake, without regard to that truth, which made it Reformation to change the Lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> may it not become queſtionable, whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> remain the Church of <hi>England</hi> or not? For I am well aſſured, that there is ſo much in queſtion amongſt us, as if it were decided for the Puritans, would caſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on the Papiſts ſide. And therefore, they who believe no ſalvation out of Gods Church are to change nothing for other reaſons, then ſuch as the Viſible Unity of it may juſtifie, in caſe it appear to bee founded by God.</p>
               <p>For that Principle, as it is evidence in maters of Faith queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable<note place="margin">Wee cannot bee the ſame Church with that which was, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</note> amongſt us; ſo it is the Standard in mater of Church Law, to meaſure the diſtance between the true point of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by that which is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the Catholique Church; allowing for that difference,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48725:17"/> which the change of time may have brought forth. They that find themſelves bound by this principle, to bee viſibly one and the ſame Church with the Catholick, will find it eaſie, to impe, and to ingraffe the Faith and Lawes of this Church, into the Original and Catholick Faith and Lawes of Gods whole Church, by this Rule; But impoſſible, to make us viſibly the ſame Church with it upon other Terms.</p>
               <p>I do no ways doubt, that, though a change ſhould bee made<note place="margin">Though that which ſhall bee ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tled will find advocates.</note> for the worſe, (which God forbid) there would bee found men to maintain it. For, the Lawes of Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are of great force to frame the opinions and manners of particular perſons: And that in mater of Religion, in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, where Chriſtianity is ſetled by the Lawes of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties. And the Church goods, which are now recovered out of the hands of Uſurpers, muſt then bee the reward of thoſe, that ſhall have moſt to ſay for the Lawes that ſhall bee made. And therefore, while wee are upon this plea for our ſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I find it no unreaſonable freedome that I take, to ſet forth the conſequence of it, in the change that is or may bee pretended.</p>
               <p>I know it is a Maxime neceſſary to the quiet of all States,<note place="margin">Civil Lawes of Religion to bee changed, till this Rule bee attained.</note> that Lawes are not to bee changed, for hope of amendment. But it is no leſs neceſſary to enter an Exception to it, for thoſe Lawes, by which the Reformation is to bee ſetled, in ſeveral Sovereignties of Chriſtendom. For, if the Viſible Unity of the Church bee Gods Ordinance, then they ought all to have been made, of neceſſity, ambulatory, as proviſions only for the time; and not to bee taken for ſetled, till all had been agreed upon a Rule, whereby Communion might bee maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, whatſoever differences might fall out any where. And I am well aſſured, that they could never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any ſuch Proviſion, without ſuppoſing the Viſible Unity of the whole Church; the grounds and conſequences of which Suppoſition, being taken for Gods Ordinance, firſt brought it to paſs. And having attained it, I am well perſwaded, that the breach between the Reformation and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could not have ſubſiſted. Now, that ſeveral Sovereignties have made their ſeveral changes, without communicating with one another; (that is, as not tyed to the Viſible Unity of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48725:18"/> Whole) it is become infinitely more difficult to unite them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſely agreeing in this principle; then it would bee to unite all, agreeing in it. For the grounds and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it would bee, neceſſarily, the Scale to balance, and the Standard to meaſure all differences.</p>
               <p>They who, for the preſent, are not divided about Religion<note place="margin">The beginning and riſe of our differences.</note> as wee are, may perhaps think theſe conſiderations too far fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to trouble themſelves with. Wee that cannot make up the preſent breaches without new proviſions, are onely to adviſe, whether wee will truſt God, and our Lord Chriſt, with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, weighing by our own Weights, and meting by our own Meaſures. For our caſe is evidently this. The Reformation under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. raiſed a party againſt it, not as preferring <hi>Luther</hi> before <hi>Calvin,</hi> but as preferring Unity with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, before difference from the preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Relation of the troubles at <hi>Francford,</hi> publiſhed by the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, ſhews, that they were as much divided about obedience to their Sovereign, perſecuting the Reformation which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, as about obedience to their Biſhops, and the power of erecting Churches of themſelves. When the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came forth, the Papiſts, who, from the beginning of her Reign, had outwardly conformed to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion eſtabliſhed by her Lawes, withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in obedience to the Bull, got thereby the name of <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</hi> About the ſame time, they that reſted not content with the Reformation eſtabliſhed, appearing in a party, got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of <hi>Puritans.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that the Jealouſie of the State upon the other party, together with the hatred of the people againſt it, for the perſecutions under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> gave them boldneſs and opportunity to ſhew themſelves, and ſucceſs to make them conſiderable. That abatement of the Forme ſetled under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. which, to content them, had been made under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> gave them appetite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand more. The Recuſants in the mean time, as conſenting to the attempts that were made againſt the perſon of the Sovereign, and the State, by virtue of that Bull; (becauſe, in mater of Religion, they all gave obedience to it) were involved in ſuch penalties, as the ſeverity of the Lawes, occaſioned by the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of thoſe attempts, provided.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48725:18"/>
               <p>Thus paſſed the time on, till the ſame appetite, animated<note place="margin">The preſent ſtate of them.</note> by the Credit of the late Parliament, helped the pretenſes thereof for reforming the Government, to ſet three Kingdomes, upon pretenſe of Religion alſo, on the Fire of one Civil Warre. For the Iriſh Rebellion, which the example of the Scottiſh Commotion had brought forth, falling in with the one party, (though not ſo heartily, as the new Inſurrection of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the other) made the breach wider, by uniting all into two parties. The quarrel being decided, they who pretended no more for the Warre, but Epiſcopacy, Liturgy, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, brought in a new Confeſſion of Faith, and new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes, as well as a Directory, and an Ordinance for Church-Government. The ſword, that had decided the quarrel, it ſeems, was to make good the difference, without pleading the Word for the trial of it. In the mean time, I will not ſay that thoſe damnable Doctrines, preached by the Sects which the Warre had brought forth, are the neceſſary conſequences of the Doctrine brought in of new: And of the difference between it, and that which was before. But this I will ſay, that there is no Viſible difference between the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes;</hi> Theſe ſheltring themſelves under the quality of thoſe, whenſoever the Law forbids their peculiar Aſſemblies. And I ſay farther, that, if there bee ſuch a thing as a Catholick Church, all the Phrenſies of the Phanaticks are juſtly imputable to thoſe that diſtinguiſh not themſelves from Phanaticks; But admit them to their Communion as Phanaticks. Upon this account I uſe the name of Puritans, though ſeeming a term of diſgrace, to compriſe all the Sects, into which, that once common name hath ſince been divided. For I uſe alſo the name of Papiſts, not intending any diſgrace by it, though firſt taken up in that ſenſe; Becauſe it ſeemeth, that uſe hath rendred that ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
               <p>Hence it may appear, why it is not to be ſaid, that; The<note place="margin">What terms of agreement, with the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, wee ought to allow.</note> Papiſts ſtanding ſtiffe in maintaining all the abuſes, which, wee are called Proteſtants for proteſting againſt, it will not bee for the honour of the Reformation, to owne any imperfection in it: It will occaſion weak Souls to fall away to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, ſuppoſing him a Chriſtian that objects this, I would ask him, in the firſt place; Whether it bee not more for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48725:19"/> the purpoſe of a Chriſtian, to have a plea that will bear him out at the great day of Judgment, than to have a Plea that may advantage his party here? Whether hee and I can agree upon any better Plea, for the Change which wee call Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our adhering to it, then their evident rigour, in maintaining their evident abuſes; That they admit no terms of peace and reconcilement, but thoſe upon which they united their own party againſt us, at the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> And would hee have u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to imitate them here, in that which wee mean to plead againſt them, at the day of Judgment? For, if there bee ſuch a thing as a Viſible Church, then ought the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to condeſcend to ſuch terms as may reſtore Unity; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and improving, as much as may bee, the Common Chriſtianity. It is the beſt Plea that wee ſhall have for our ſelves at the Day of Judgment, why wee continue divided from them; That they give us no appearance of hope, that they will condeſcend to any ſuch terms. And therefore wee ought to condeſcend to terms of Agreement, in ſuch matters as wee have in diſpute, with our Brethren the Presbyterians. But not ſuch terms as Faction and Prejudice imagineth, but ſuch as the Common Chriſtianity, and the Original Unity of Gods Church determineth. For, if wee uſe that Rigour which wee charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with, wee <hi>weigh not by our own Weights,</hi> nor <hi>mete by our own Meaſures.</hi> But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What appearance is there of deſpair, that the Lawes of the Primitive Church will not ſerve; With that allowance, which the change of times, and the difference of the caſe may require? Such a change would reconcile them, and not as Presbyterians. Such a change would clear us from all Imputation of Schiſme, with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Such a change would produce that Improvement in Chriſtianity, which the name of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48725:19"/> pretendeth. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have no cauſe to laugh at ſuch a Change; Unleſs they would laugh for joy, at that Improvement of the common Chriſtianity, which they themſelves would preſently ſtand obliged to imitate. They themſelves, who would be accounted Infallible, were glad to provide for Unity among themſelves, by new Decrees, at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Thoſe that think they may fail, and know, that all poſitive Lawes, ſaving the Goſpel, which our Lord Chriſt came in perſon to preach, (for that alſo, may, in ſome reſpect, be accounted Poſitive) are ſubject to that Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the change of time either produceth or diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are to think it no reproach to change for the better, when the neceſſity of reconciling a Schiſme requireth it. Let Papiſts glean up here and there a weak Proſelyte; (ſuch for the moſt part, as, little troubled in Conſcience with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of difference, ſeek onely what to palliate their Intereſt with) Who can propoſe a general good, without danger of particular offenſe? It was a divine ſaying of an Heathen; That the good cauſe paſſes from that ſide that refuſes reaſon, to that ſide that proffers it.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhall wee charge them at the day of Judgment, for<note place="margin">Our preſent Caſe is not the Caſe of our Forefathers.</note> adhering to Cuſtome againſt Truth; To their Forefathers, againſt that which was from the beginning; And adhere our ſelves to that, wherein, wee cannot ſay that our Forefathers have reſtored it? Certainly, if wee will weigh by our own Weights, and mete by our own Meaſures, wee are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with our Forefathers againſt the Catholick Church, if wee ſuppoſe it Gods Ordinance. For their Caſe is not our Caſe, now the Caſe is put, that Unity in Religion cannot bee had, without a new Law of the Kingdom. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath ſucceeded ſince the Reformation which they made. If it bee the ſecond blow that makes the quarrel, it is not the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouncil of <hi>Trent,</hi> that hath formed the Schiſme between us and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The publiſhing of it is the declaring of a Law, upon admitting whereof, wee may communicate with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> otherwiſe not. And ſo on our ſide, the ſetling of Religion by a new Law of the Kingdom will bee a Declaration, that wee will have no peace, without ſo much more, then our Reformation hitherto hath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48725:20"/> demanded. For if the Unity of the Church be Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it is not in the power of any part of it, to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon thoſe Conditions, which they ought not to ſtand upon, with the reſt of the Church, if they could not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to it, without ſuch conditions. So, they may bee no Schiſmaticks in Gods ſight, for changing without the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they knew would not conſent to the change; And yet wee may bee Schiſmaticks, in defying it upon new terms of diſtance.</p>
               <p>When I ſpeak of our forefathers, I accompt not the Acts of<note place="margin">The Acts of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. no Acts of our Forefathers Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the eight the Acts of our forefathers, in mater of Religion. For it is manifeſt, that he left not the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon any pretenſe of reforming Religion; Further then the removing of that power, which indeed hindred it; nor as hindring it, but as burthenſome in his own caſe. If any beginnings of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were brought in upon this occaſion, during his time, wee have reaſon to own the things done, without diſputing the reaſon for which they were done. Otherwiſe, wee are not engaged to his proceedings, becauſe they made way for the Reformation to ſucceed. They who declaim againſt the perſecutions raiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they deſerve; (while the bloody Law of the ſix Articles, and the perſecuting of the Popes authority at the ſame time, is buried in ſilence;) do not <hi>weigh by their own Weights,</hi> nor <hi>mete by their own Meaſures.</hi> The pretenſe of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. excuſes much defect in the forme of proceeding, by the mater which it introduced. They might make uſe of that which had been done to another intent. Wee are not to meaſure their Actions, by the Actions of them which were guided by other reaſons.</p>
               <p>In fine, to maintain other mens Actions, is to make our ſelves<note place="margin">Imperfection of Lawes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to our Forefathers.</note> acceſſory to their ſins in doing them. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtanding to that which they received from their Forefathers, ſtand but to that corruption, to which, that State of Religion, which the Apoſtles brought in, hath degenerated by tract of time. That our Forefathers ſhould not at once ſee, or ſeeing ſhould not at once be able to reſtore all that was decayed, is no Imputation to men not pretending infallibility. Why they have not ſince proceeded to reſtore the reſt; I have ſhewed evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the contrary Factions of Papiſts and Puritans, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48725:20"/> effects of them, which our times have ſeen. They themſelves profeſs an imperfection, in not reſtoring of Penance; a mater of ſuch conſequence, that all the judgements of God, which wee have ſuffered, may juſtly bee imputed to it. And therefore, the neceſſity of this time requiring a change, the introducing of that which never was, for the contenting of men, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring that which was, and therefore ought to bee, will bee the ſin of the Nation; the declaring of this, will bee the diſcharge of him that is ſo perſwaded.</p>
               <p>As for the Plea of tender Conſciences, to him that conſiders<note place="margin">The pretenſe of tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is no Rule.</note> our Caſe, in which it is made, it will eaſily appear to bee a Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for all horſes; A pair of Stirrups, to bee lengthned or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all ſtatures. For wee are tyed to this ſuppoſition; The Law is to bee re-eſtabliſhed, according to which God muſt bee ſerved by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the future. And, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend tenderneſs of Conſcience againſt the Law of the Church and Kingdom, is to proclaim diſobedience to all Lawes, that are not made by them who allege it. For, why may not any Law meet with tender conſciences, if ſome do? And, tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a thing inviſible, which no Law can take for granted on any ſide. But, ſuppoſing the Unity of the Church ordained by God; to forbear thoſe Lawes which it requireth, becauſe tenderneſs of conſcience may bee alleged againſt them, is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the whole rather then a part. For, the ſame might have been alleged againſt any Law of Gods Church. So, there could have been no ſuch thing as a Viſible Church, if that plea could have ſerved mens turns.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould not a Papiſt have a tender conſcience, as well<note place="margin">It ſerves Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as well as Puritans.</note> as a Puritan? Why ſhould not the one expect to bee free from the penalties, which the Lawes aſſign to thoſe that refuſe them: as well as the other, to have right to the rewards, which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to thoſe that imbrace them; both profeſſing the ſame reaſon, though the one only makes a noiſe with pleading it? If it bee ſaid, that Engliſh Papiſts are not conſiderable, in compariſon with Engliſh Puritans; It is to bee conſidered, how great a part of Chriſtendom is engaged in the cauſe of Engliſh Papiſts; How ſmall a part of the Reformation is engaged in the cauſe of Engliſh Puritans. In the mean time, it is the Papiſts that are under the penalties of the Lawes; Which, Puritans are ſcandalized, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48725:21"/> they may not make. And certainly, no man can truely have a tender conſcience in this caſe, but he who, for his part, labours, that neither Papiſts may have cauſe to continue Papiſts, nor Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans to continue Puritans. But the conſcience of the Kingdom, that is, our hope of Gods bleſſing, or our fear of his vengeance, will bee concerned to the life in it.</p>

                     <hi>Eraſtians</hi> can acknowledg no Viſible Church founded by God. Their opinion inableth So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns to perſecute Gods truth by Gods Law. Perſecuting the truth is the uſe of a Power which no Sovereign can have. If any Sovereign may puniſh for the Religion which hee profeſſeth, then are Subjects bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt, if the Sovereign command it. No offenſe, but charity, in declaring the true ground of reconcilement, or puniſhment. Why it ought to bee declared. The declaring of it no offenſe to Superiors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat which hath been ſaid of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. and his Acts,<note place="margin">Eraſtians can acknowledg no Viſible Church founded by God.</note> ſheweth; That Acts of Parliament cannot bee the Meaſure of Religion, though they ſhould bee the Fenſe and the Bulwark of it. Let me now, upon this occaſion, conjure our Brethren the Presbyterians, to lay to heart the unknown danger which this time threatneth, the evident miſchiefe which it produceth. It was a complaint viſibly juſt in the late Uſurpers time; that, while one ſide was for this Religion, another for that, they that were for no Religion would prove the ſtrongeſt ſide. Presbyterians conteſt with their Prelates, who ſhall give Law to the Church;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48725:21"/> that is, who ſhall bee the Church. They are deſirous to have authority in point of Fact, without and againſt their Prelates, which they will never make out any title to in point of right, but from their Prelates. They beleeve, all the while, that the Church is founded by God: and, all the rights upon which it is founded, of Right; And yet can find in their hearts to ſtand wrangling out the time, while they grow the greateſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that would have no Church at all, and by conſequence, no Chriſtianity. Wee call them <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> becauſe the diſputes of our times have made it evident; that, if no Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he pretended, then no Church. Yet it is not to bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he ever ſaw through the conſequences of his own Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or would have held no Excommunication, had he thought it would infer no Church. I will not ſay the learned <hi>Selden</hi> ſaw not the conſequence. For, why ſhould I ſpeak of the opinion of a man, that was too wiſe to declare it? I am ſure he miſtook the ſtate of the Queſtion, when, beginning to declare his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the point of Excommunication, (for, hee never argued for any part of his opinion, till hee publiſhed his Books <hi>de Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driis</hi>) hee defined Excommunication to bee a cenſure inferring a civil penalty. For it was evident, that all his Adverſaries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving the power of Excommunication from the Apoſtles, muſt deny any civil effect of Excommunication; which they knew it could not have before <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion is liable to an objection viſible enough. For if<note place="margin">Their opinion inableth Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Gods truth by Gods Law.</note> it were true, then all Subjects, all private Chriſtians, would ſtand bound in conſcience, to profeſs that Religion which the Sovereign power enacteth, by the Lawes which it giveth. Which if it were ſo, in vain do wee Diſpute, whether the Papiſts, the Prelatick, or the Puritans bee in the right. Whatſoever Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the Law of the Land ſhall eſtabliſh, ſhall bee that which God enjoyneth. And, the Sovereign ſhall bee able in point of conſcience to puniſh thoſe that refuſe it, whether right or wrong; though it cannot be denyed, that, as Chriſtendom is at preſent divided, ſome Subjects muſt needs bee puniſhed for the right. I know but one that hath looked this objection in the face. His firſt Anſwer was; that they that are puniſhed for the right Religion ſhall bee gainers by their ſufferings; they ſhall have their ſhare in the reward of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> This is the Anſwer that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate made the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48725:22"/> Chriſtians, complaining of their ſufferings under him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident, that a Chriſtian muſt not allege it. For, if he that ſuffers ſhall have a <hi>Martyrs</hi> reward, what reward ſhall he that puniſheth have, but a Perſecutors? So, a Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, for uſing the power that God gives him, ſhall have a Perſecutors reward.</p>
               <p>If it bee ſaid; No marvel. Becauſe he uſes it amiſs, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Perſecuting the truth is the uſe of a Power, which no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign can have.</note> he goes beyond the bounds of it; Either God hath enacted the contrary of that which the Sovereign enjoyneth, or not. If not, then is that which the Sovereign enjoyneth contrary to no Law of God. And therefore it obligeth the Subject. If ſo; then cannot the Sovereign Power enjoyn it. And therefore it is extended beyond the bounds of it, in that caſe. Again, either, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his power, by enacting that Religion which he ought not, he obligeth his Subject in conſcience to God, to profeſs and to exerciſe the Religion, which he enacteth, or not, If not, then muſt the Subject, for the ſecurity of his conſcience, bee Judge whether the Sovereign abuſe his power or not. If ſo, then, as before, wee Diſpute about Religion to no purpoſe; For every man is bound to that which the Law of his Country enacteth. Nay there will be no reaſon why Chriſtians, under the Turk, ſhall not live as Mahumetans. For the quality of a Chriſtian is one and the ſame, in the Subject, as in the Sovereign. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can appear no reaſon, why it ſhould give the one the right, by the Act of his Will to oblige the will of the other; which an undoubted Sovereign, a Pagan, or a Mahumetan hath not. And indeed he hath anſwered otherwiſe ſince. Namely; That a man is bound to renounce Chriſt with his mouth, if the Sovereign command it; For hee ſhall bee ſaved by beleeving in him with the heart the ſame time, which is all that his Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requireth. This Anſwer is plain Engliſh. But it comes to this point; That a Chriſtian is ſaved by the inward act of Faith,<note place="margin">If any Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which hee profeſſeth, then are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bound to renounce Chriſt, if the Sovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</note> without the outward; By beleeving, without profeſſing.</p>
               <p>There is another that intended, it ſeems, to ſhew the late U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, by what right hee might protect both Presbyteries and Congregations, dealing with others according to his Intereſt. He ſuppoſeth that a Chriſtian, being juſtified by his Faith, is at his choiſe to make himſelf the member, either of an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Congregation, or of one that ſhall aſſociate it ſelf into a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48725:22"/> Presbytery with others. Whereupon the Sovereign, ſuppoſing both of them to bee the <hi>Godly party,</hi> muſt needs finde himſelf bound to protect them both. He ſaith not by what right he could puniſh thoſe for their Religion, whom hee took not for the <hi>Godly party;</hi> By what right hee could hinder them in the free profeſſion and exerciſe of their Religion; which indeed is a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then a Chriſtian, neither Haeretick nor Schiſmatick, can bee bound to endure. But hee need not tell him, by what right hee could exclude them from belonging to the <hi>Godly party.</hi> Thoſe whoſe Religion cannot ſtand with Uſurpation cannot ſeem <hi>Godly</hi> to Uſurpers. In the mean time, as you ſee, this Author ſtands upon the ſame ground with his fellow; that a Chriſtian is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inward act of Faith without the outward, by beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without profeſſing. Only hee ſaith; by beleeving before hee profeſs; the other, though hee profeſs the contrary of that which he beleeveth. But neither of both hath offered to ſay; either that the Will of the Sovereign is, by Gods Law, the Rule of Religion to the will of the Subject, which hee is to anſwer God by at the day of Judgement; Or, that Gods Law can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Sovereign to puniſh the Subject for that Religion, which it enableth not the Sovereign to oblige his Subject to profeſs. All muſt come to this point; that a Chriſtian is bound to renounce Chriſt, if his Sovereign command it. For if a Chriſtian bee bound in conſcience, to obey whatſoever his Sovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, in point of Religion; then, if the Great Turke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Subjects to renounce Chriſt, they are bound to obey it. Which whether it bee not a poſition for Macchiavellian Atheiſts; that make no more of Chriſtianity, then of an expedient to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern people in peace; I leave to all that are capable to judge. Thus much for certain, he that thinks himſelf tyed to renounce his Chriſtianity, if his Sovereign command him, is no longer a Chriſtian; As having recalled the Vow of his Baptiſme, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt until death. And this is that which I conjure our Brethren the Presbyterians to lay to heart; That the viſible growth of this opinion, by their continuing this diſtance upon trifles, threatens to render them that would have no Religion at<note place="margin">No offenſe, but charity, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the true ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, or puniſhment.</note> all the ſtrongeſt ſide.</p>
               <p>In this open and ſtiff oppoſition of four Religions, though not diſtinguiſhed into four Communions; <hi>Recuſants, Prelatickes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48725:23"/> Puritans,</hi> and <hi>Eraſtians;</hi> (For I overſee the <hi>Fanatiques,</hi> as ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed back into the belly of the Presbyterians) ſhall it bee a crime, ſhall it bee an offenſe for me to ſay, what point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, in my poor opinion, reconciles all to unity, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Gods truth? That, beleeving two Articles of our Creed; <hi>One Catholick and Apoſtolick Church; and one Baptiſm for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins;</hi> if wee beleeve that they ſignifie any thing, wee are all bound to ſubmit all partialities, to that which they ſignifie. Not as if <hi>Recuſants,</hi> depending upon a Forain communion, and the head of it, that ſhows no inclination to Unity, upon terms of Gods truth, were likely to take notice of one mans poor opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, concerning the conſequences of common principles. But becauſe wee are our ſelves ſo far chargeable to God, for our Schiſme with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the miſchiefes of it, as wee neglect thoſe conſequences: And, becauſe the Juſtice of the Kingdom, in the penalties of all Recuſancy, may eaſily bee rendred viſible, if wee keep cloſe to them; but not poſſibly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. As for thoſe that make the Pope Antichriſt, and the Papiſts Idolaters; can they bee allowed to forejudge my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it makes our Reconcilement with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> eaſier then they would have it? For, if diviſion in the Church, without evident and valuable cauſe, bee a ſin to God, it will certainly bee the ſin of the Kingdom, to bear them out in it, by ſtating our Reformation upon undue grounds. For the terms of it muſt needs bee according to the grounds of it; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either inviſible, or inconſiderable in compariſon of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Unity, muſt needs tranſlate ſome part of the blame to reſt upon that ſide which exceeds.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to excuſe my freedom, in publiſhing that<note place="margin">Why it ought to bee declared.</note> which follows; Let no man grudge me this Plea for my ſelf at the day of Judgement; that being convicted, that our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot bee acceptable to God, but upon the conſequence of thoſe two ſuppoſitions, according to that which follows; I am not at reſt till I have ſaid it. Could there bee peace had, by compounding the Intereſt of two parties, without providing for the Intereſt of our common Chriſtianity, in thoſe two Articles; what joy could a Chriſtian expect, of that which ſhould bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at ſo unconſcionable a Rate? Here is nothing ſaid, but that which hath been ſaid, when Arbitrary power might have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48725:23"/> made it a pretenſe for Perſecution, had the Intereſt of Uſurpers allowed it. It is a ſhort view of that which I have publiſhed heretofore, preſented to thoſe that may deſire to ſee, in one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, what is the true conſequence of it, in the compoſing of thoſe differences, that remain ſtill on foot. And, the danger of being involved in the Crime of Schiſme before God, obligeth me to declare that opinion, which being not declared, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me lyable to that charge in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is no offenſe to Superiors in declaring it. The<note place="margin">The declaring of it no offenſe to Superiors.</note> Lawes of Kingdoms go by a Rule, that is made of ſuch metal as may bend, and be fitted to the body which they are to rule. Only they are to aim at an inflexible Rule of Gods truth; which is the Inheritance of every Chriſtian. And therefore, he that ſees it made crooked, is bound to ſet it ſtraight. This is not to ſay, what publique Authority ſhould do; but what it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do. A thing neceſſary, to bee ſaid, when there bee thoſe, who would have it intend that which it ought not to do. In fine, the difficulty and danger of our caſe ſeems to ſuperſede, for the preſent, the Rule of Obedience in the Church.</p>

               <p>I Say then, that the Unity of the Church ſignifies nothing, unleſs it ſignifie the Viſible Unity of Communion, in the

And I ſay it, becauſe I conceive I have proved it by the ſame evidence, upon which wee accept the Scriptures for the Word of God: Upon which wee hold our common Chriſtianity. For I have ſhewed, that wee believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the Scriptures; the matter of Faith for the Motives of Faith, there related. That is, wee hold thoſe things which the Scriptures relate, ſufficient to oblige all the people of God afore Chriſt to bee Jewes; All the people of the world after Chriſt to bee Chriſtians. This, in the nature of a reaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging a man to bee a Chriſtian. For, in the nature and kind of an effective cauſe, I do not ſuppoſe, much leſs grant, that any thing is ſufficient, much leſs effectual, without Gods Spirit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My anſwer muſt bee, that the conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in ſubmitting to the Goſpel, (which they would not have done, had they not known the motives to bee true, for which they did it) aſſures mee as much, that they are true, as if I had ſeen the things done, which moved them to believe. Eſpecially, being as much convicted by the light of Reaſon and Nature, that Chriſtianity goes beyond Judaiſme, for advancing the Service of God and goodneſs; as that Judaiſme goes beyond the Religion, either of Pagans, or Mahumetans.</p>
               <p>For, this being the reaſon why wee believe, that muſt bee<note place="margin">The Church founded upon the Power of the Key<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Chriſtians, in ſubmitting to Chriſtianity upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives recorded in the Scriptures, aſſure mee that they are true; And therefore the Scriptures the Word of God, and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the onely Religion by which wee can bee ſaved; Then the conſent of all Chriſtians, in owning the obligation of holding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48725:24"/> Viſible Communion with the Church, is to aſſure mee that it is Gods Ordinance. For the act, or the acts of our Lord, upon which the Church is founded, I allege the Power of the Keyes, deſcribed by the effect of <hi>binding and looſing;</hi> and to that effect granted to St. <hi>Peter</hi> Mat. XVI. 18, 19; To the Diſciples aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled after the Reſurrection <hi>John</hi> XX. 19-23. in the terms of <hi>remitting and retaining ſinne;</hi> To the Church <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 15-18. in the ſame terms as to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> to the effect of rendring him that obeys not, <hi>a Heathen man or a Publican,</hi> to him that would bee a Chriſtian. Here you have a certain Power, depoſited with certain Perſons, the effect whereof is Viſible, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Perſon, deriving the authority which they claim, from the viſible act of thoſe Perſons which are here truſted with it: And in the maintenance of Viſible Communion amongſt true Chriſtians, by excluding the falſe. It is true; Haereticks and Schiſmaticks exclude themſelves out of the Church. For, they would bee the Church themſelves, if they could tell how. But it is the authority of the Church that obligeth Chriſtians to avoid them, as the Jewes, to whom our Lord ſpake, did then avoid <hi>Heathen men and Publicans.</hi> And it obligeth, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them Haereticks and Schiſmaticks. I know there bee thoſe, that would have the imputation of Haereſie and Schiſme to bee now meer Bug-bears, to fright children with. But would any of them owne any of the Sects, which were ſhut out of the Church for Haereticks or Schiſmaticks, from the time of our Lord till the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for true Chriſtians? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or they would not, is not conſiderable. For if all good Chriſtians then did, then did all good Chriſtians owne the Viſible Unity of the Church. And there is as great a conſent of Chriſtians in the Viſible Unity of the Church, as in the truth of Chriſtianity, ſaving this difference; That all Chriſtians, good and bad, true and falſe, agree in the truth of Chriſtianity; Onely thoſe that are neither Haereticks nor Schiſmaticks in the Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p>Let no man miſtake this evidence, as if ſo great a truth<note place="margin">The Unity of the Church Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by the Lawes of it.</note> were read onely in two or three Texts of Scripture. They who take upon them to argue of ſuch matters as theſe, ought to know, that the Lawes of all Commonwealths, when firſt they are founded, are the wills of their Rulers; according to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48725:25"/> that meaſure of Power whereby they Rule. Therefore, if our Lord truſt his Diſciples, and their Succeſſours, with the Rule of his Church, hee truſts them alſo to make Lawes for the Ruling of it; Provided that they tend to inforce, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void thoſe Lawes, which hee in perſon hath left them as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For Diſciples, that is, Chriſtians, hee left them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; Not actually Members of his Church, as not yet actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed, though virtually founded, in the Power of the Keyes which hee left his Diſciples. Theſe Lawes are as Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Lawes of any Kingdom or Commonwealth that is or ever was, are Viſible. I do not owne the Popes Canon Law to have the force of obliging us. For I maintain a great deal of Uſurpation in the Power by which it was made; as well as a great deal of abuſe, in making the Law given by our Lord of no effect, by the matter of it. But I maintain the Popes Canon Law (and the ſame is to bee ſaid of that Canon Law, whereby the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> now governs in the Eaſtern Church) to bee derived from thoſe Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Diſciples of our Lord and their Succeſſours governed the Primitive Church in Unity. And this no leſs evident, then the Chriſtianity of this time is to bee derived from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity of that time. For, as the preſent Law of the Church is but the corruption of the Primitive, no more is the preſent Chriſtianity, (whether of the Reformation, or of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) but the corruption of the Primitive. For why ſhall I make nice to ſay it, pretending all Reformation to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the reſtoring of Primitive Chriſtianity; And, to that end, of ſuch Lawes in the Church, as may bee the means to reſtore it?</p>
               <p>Among thoſe Lawes there is one, which, obliging thoſe who<note place="margin">The Law which endoweth the Church with Conſecrated goods.</note> have given up themſelves to God for Chriſtians, to give up their goods to maintain the Aſſemblies of the Church, for the Service of God; (wherein the Communion of the Church conſiſteth) eſtateth the Power of diſpenſing the maintenance thereof upon the Rulers of the Church. This proviſion, how little ſoever notice many take of it, who pretend to underſtand the Scriptures; began firſt in our Lord, and the Diſciples that attended upon him continually. For, it is evident by the Goſpels, that thoſe Diſciples which did not attend upon him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48725:25"/> continually furniſhed, by their contributions, a ſtock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſubſiſted. <hi>Judas</hi> you know was truſted with it, and was the firſt that committed Sacrilege, in robbing the poor of Church goods. For the poor could not have attended upon the Doctrine of our Lord, had they not been provided for, by the richer of his Diſciples. And the goods of the Church are ſtill the patrimony of the poor, for the ſame reaſon; that being provided for, they may attend upon Gods ſervice. Therefore the reaſon was the ſame, when the Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> gave up their lands and their goods, to maintain the Church, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual attendance upon the Service of God: When the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> maintained their Feaſts of Love: When the Chriſtians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards built thoſe Churches, and laid thoſe lands to them, which, <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, being pulled down and confiſcated by <hi>Diocletian,</hi> were reſtored by <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> When Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States, by a civil Law, indowed the Church with Tithes, and Glebes, and Manſions. A thing as general as Chriſtianity; no People, no Country being known, where the Church was ever ſetled, without maintenance eſtated upon it; by the Church it ſelf at the leaſt, if not by the Law of the Country, over and above.</p>
               <p>The form of Government, in every Commonwealth, is ſtated<note place="margin">How the Unity of the Church is ſignified by the Scriptures.</note> upon certain powers, wherein Sovereignty conſiſteth; which Lawyers and Philoſophers call ſometimes <hi>Jura majeſtatis.</hi> Here you have, in the Governors of the Church, the power of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into and excluding out of the Church: The power of giving Lawes to the Church: The power of diſpenſing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer which God hath provided for the Church: And in fine, the power of propagating theſe rights to their ſucceſſours. Whereby it pretendeth not to bee a Commonwealth; Becauſe Chriſtianity pretendeth to maintain Civil power, and the right of this World, in the ſame hands, and upon the ſame terms which it findeth. But it appeareth to bee a Viſible Society, founded by God, under the name of the Catholick Church, upon the command of holding communion therewith; to which hee obligeth all Chriſtians. And all thoſe Scriptures of the New Teſtament, that mention any of theſe rights, ſignifie no leſs, when the meaning of them is meaſured by that Rule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no means to determine the ſenſe of any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48725:26"/> that is queſtionable. And the ſame is ſignified by thoſe Scriptures, which mention ſometimes ſeveral Churches, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one Church containing all Chriſtians, and all Churches. For the parts; that is, particular Churches; being Viſible B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Whole muſt needs bee underſtood to bee a Viſible Church. The practice of all Chriſtians; owning an obligation in point of Right, to maintain the powers, which the Scriptures for the moſt part, only mention as mater of Fact; determines them to ſignifie more then they expreſs.</p>
               <p>As for the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; the calling of the<note place="margin">How in the Old Teſtament.</note> Gentiles, to bee one new people of God with the Jewes that ſhould beleeve, is but foretold in them by Propheſie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Viſible Unity of the Church, conſiſting of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee otherwiſe declared in them, then by that correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in which the Church anſwereth the antient people of God. The Unity thereof was the Unity of a Commonwealth, maintaining it ſelf by force of Armes, in the poſſeſſion of the Land of promiſe; in which God had placed them, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to live by his Law.

It becometh Viſible by the free will of Chriſtians, beleeving it a piece of their Chriſtianity, to live &amp; die members of one Viſible Church. The Unity of the Jews State, tending to a temporal end, of enjoying the Land of promiſe, anſwereth not the inviſible unity of Chriſtian ſouls, but the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Unity of a Catholick Church; according to that rate, in which the Law anſwers the Goſpel. And ſo is this point of Chriſtianity no leſs clearly delivered, by the Old Teſtament, then other points of the Chriſtian Faith are.</p>

               <p>FOr, though all that is neceſſary to bee known, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation<note place="margin">How far the Scriptures are clear to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of themſelves.</note> of all Chriſtians, bee not onely ſufficiently, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly contained in the Scriptures; yet, how clearly there laid down, depends upon the purpoſe, for which, God declares that hee gave the ſeveral parts of it. It is manifeſt, that God intended to vaile the New Teſtament in the Old, and to reveal the Old Teſtament by the New. Therefore Chriſtianity cannot bee clearly delivered in the Old Teſtament. Till our Lord was to leave the world, hee declared not the condition of Chriſtianity, by which wee are ſaved. Hee declared not that which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared when hee was to leave the world; to wit, that it was thenceforth to conſiſt in undertaking to profeſs the Faith of the Holy Trinity, and to live by Chriſts precepts, though ones life
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48725:27"/> lye upon it. For he declared not the promiſe of ſending the Holy Ghoſt, till hee was ready to leave the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Baptiſme of Chriſt, by which Chriſtians do make that proſeſſion, which ſaveth us, was not inſtituted till his departure. And though our Lord had clearly preached the precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, from the beginning; yet is the Viſible eſtate of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body the Church, as well as the inviſible eſtate of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members, darkly figured and typified, not only by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of the Goſpel, but, as well by that which befell him, as by that which he did, during the time of his preaching. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither is Chriſtianity clearly delivered by the Goſpels. To them, to whom the Apoſtles writ their Epiſtles, the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity muſt needs bee known; for they had been made Chriſtians upon the profeſſing of it. But their Epiſtles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſe it, and therefore cannot pretend to deliver it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the greateſt part of them is ſpent in proving that wee are ſaved by Chriſtianity, out of the Old Teſtament: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by that correſpondence, in which the Law anſwers the Goſpel, the Church, the Synagogue, and the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Land of promiſe. And though our Lord opened his Diſciples hearts, thus to underſtand the Scriptures; yet are not all that ſhall bee ſaved able to make out this correſpondence; the profeſſing and performing of that Chriſtianity, whereby they are ſaved, not requiring it. Therefore, neither are the Apoſtles writings clear in things neceſſary to ſalvation, but ſuppoſing the knowledg of that Chriſtianity, whereby wee are ſaved; nor abſolutely clear, but to thoſe that are able to make out that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. Without this limitation, it is not to bee granted, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear to all that ſeek ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by the Scriptures alone. For, what mark is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Scripture, to diſtinguiſh that which is neceſſary to ſalvation, from that which is not?</p>
               <p>Nor is there any inconvenience in all this, to them that are<note place="margin">Tradition li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth the ſenſe of the Scripture.</note> content to lay prejudice aſide, and to ſee that which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee. For it will appear by the writings of the Apoſtles, that they committed the Doctrine of Chriſtianity to them whom they truſted with the founding and governing of the Church; for the inſtructing of them that were to bee baptized, and formed into Churches, whereof the whole Church was to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48725:27"/> conſiſt. So that, as they to whom the Apoſtles writ, having received their Chriſtianity from thoſe that were ſo truſted, were to limit the meaning of their writings within that Faith which they had received; So is all interpretation of Scripture ſtill to bee confined within that, which the Church, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hath received by their hands. Which is not to make any man lord of any mans Faith. For this Tradition of the Faith is before the very being of the Church; Becauſe, whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian; and ſo a member of the Church; it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that hee undertaketh the ſame. And therefore, being in force before there bee any Church, it cannot depend upon any authority to bee claimed by the Church. And the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for it is the ſame ground, into which, the reaſon of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving reſolveth; The conſent of all Chriſtians. Which, as it could not have been preſerved and obtained, had it not been required to make a man a member of that Church, which, by profeſſing it, ſtood viſibly diſtinct from all that profeſs i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not; So, ſince as much as is neceſſary to ſalvation hath been already declared, by the conſent of the Church; to confine all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture within that which all the Church, every where, at all times hath received, can make no man lord over the Faith of the Church.</p>
               <p>But there is a vaſt diſtance between this Tradition of Faith,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith and Ritual Traditions.</note> and other Traditions, which may have proceeded from that authority, and truſt for founding the Church, which our Lord left with his Apoſtles, and they with the Church. For that, being the condition upon which all Chriſtians are ſaved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains alwaies the ſame, neither to bee encreaſed nor dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed till the Worlds end. But the productions of Eccleſiaſtical power veſted in the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, can bee no more then the limiting of circumſtances, according to which, the publick Service of God is to bee performed: and thoſe powers exerciſed, which God hath granted the Church, for the maintaining of Unity, in ſerving God according to that Chriſtianity which our Lord teacheth. Chriſtianity is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them but two waies. The firſt; when they are ſo far from advancing the ſervice of God, which Chriſtianity requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is impaired and deſtroyed by corruption in them. The ſecond; when a part of the Church proceedeth to a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48725:28"/> change in them, upon pretenſe that ſo it is, though indeed it bee otherwiſe. The firſt is the plea of the Reformation againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> The ſecond, the plea of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt them, as to this point of Traditions. And the iſſue is the ſame, that is to bee tried, between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe that ſtand at this diſtance from it. For, the Unity of the Church being a part of the common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; the breach of it will bee chargeable upon that ſide, which makes ſuch a change, as the reſt have not reaſon to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. If the pretenſe thereof bee either not evident, or not ſufficient, the fault is in them; If both, in thoſe who refuſe to joyn in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The Rules, and Cuſtoms, and Rites of the Church which are called Traditions, are not commanded becauſe good, but are good becauſe commanded. And therefore, even the Traditions of the Apoſtles, being of this kind, may ceaſe to oblige, by the change that may-ſucceed in the ſtate of the Church, for which they are provided. Inſtances hereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scriptures, have been produced.</p>
               <p>They therefore that break from the Church, upon any point<note place="margin">The difference between Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and Schiſme.</note> of the Tradition of Faith; which is before the Church, as being requiſite to make a man a member of the Church; are properly called Haereticks. For, if they only disbeleeve in the heart, they may bee counted Haereticks to God; but that is nothing to the Church, of which wee now ſpeak. But they that will not ſtand to the authority of the Church, in maters ſubject to it, are Schiſmaticks. For thoſe things, to which the authority of the Church extendeth, are the mater of Schiſme. Not that this difference is alwaies obſerved. For many times, the name of Haereſie extendeth to all Sects, which mans choiſe, not the will of God createth. But becauſe there is that difference viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the mater of Chriſtianity, which many times appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth the common name of Haereſie to the moſt eminent; that Separate upon mater of Faith. Theſe things are here premiſed, to make way for the evidence which I tender, for the Viſible Unity of the Church, from the conſent of all Chriſtians. Hee that ſticketh at any point of it, may have recourſe to the proofe which I have made in due place; taking all, therefore, here, for granted.</p>

A Church then, in the ſenſe of all Chriſtians before the Reformation, is the Body of Chriſtians contained in a City, and the Territory of it. For the Government of ſuch a one, the reſpective Authority of the Apoſtles, conveyed by the overt act of their Ordination, was viſibly veſted in a Biſhop; in a number of Presbyters, for his advice and aſſiſtance; and in Deacons, attending upon them, and upon the executing of their Orders. I ſay, the reſpective authority of the Apoſtles; becauſe, as leſs Cities are ſubject to greater, in Civil Government; ſo have the Churches of leſs Cities, alwaies depended upon Churches of greater Cities, throughout Chriſtendom. <hi>Rome, Alex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which the Welſh had reaſon then to inſiſt upon, becauſe of the jealouſie which appeared from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> of their incroaching upon the Nation, if their Biſhop ſhould bee owned for the head of the Welſh Church. Setting this caſe aſide, the reſt of that little remembrance that remains, concerning the Britiſh Church, teſtifies the like reſpect from it to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears from the Churches of <hi>Gaule, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> of which there is no cauſe to doubt, that they firſt received their Chriſtianity from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if ſo they did, then is there reaſon to conclude, that they owed it the reſpect which was due to their Mother Church; But, that they either owed it, or ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the reſpect of a Subject to the Sovereign, which none is challenged, none at all. As for <hi>Illyricum,</hi> which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame reſpect after the Council of <hi>Sardica;</hi> it cannot bee thought to have owed it before, becauſe it received not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity<note place="margin">Epiſcopacy, by this form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Hereby it may appear, that the Viſible Unity of the Church muſt ſtand or fall with Epiſcopacy; And, therefore no marvel that it ſhould not bee acknowledged, by them who acknowledg
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48725:29"/> not Epiſcopacy. For, the ſoul of this unity conſiſting in the reſort of inferiour Churches to ſuperiours, and in the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of parallel Churches; neither can this reſort, nor this correſpondence ever appear to have been had and exerciſed, but between Biſhops, as heads, in behalf of their Churches. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a treaty of Biſhops, perſonally aſſembled in Council, or by correſpondence between Biſhops, by means of their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Deacons or inferiour Clergy, good intelligence were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between Churches, towards the maintaining of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the whole; it maters not. The Church, in the form which I ſtate, is a ſtanding Synod, able, by conſent of the chief Churches, containing the conſent of their reſorts, to conclude the whole. In all the records of the Church, let them ſhew me one Presbyter that ever anſwered for his Church, to the reſt of the Church, at leaſt in his own name; (for, if in the name of, and by Commiſſion from his Biſhop, it is for my turn) and let them take all. And therefore, though Epiſcopacy muſt needs bee declared for part of Gods Law, by the Scriptures, underſtood as the conſent of the Church directeth; (againſt which, no Scripture can bee rightly underſtood) yet, ſuppoſing the Church Viſible by Gods Law, I have enough to make them Schiſmatickes that oppoſe it; though I ſhould make Epiſcopacy no part of Gods Law, but introduced by conſent of the whole Church. For, that part which ſubmitteth not to the conſent of the Whole, in maters which Gods Law referreth to the Whole, for the preſervation of that unity which it enacteth, are juſtly to bee taken for thoſe that violate the Unity which Gods Law enacteth; Epecially, in a Law of that conſequence, as one of thoſe Rights, wherein the chief power of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. It is ſtrange to ſee how fondly men argue; that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have the power of the Keys, which made the Apoſtles Apoſtles; Therefore much more are they equal to Biſhops. As if they could not have that power in private maters, between God and the conſcience of particular Chriſtians; Reſerving the ſame power for the Biſhops peculiar, in things, which, being publick, concern the Body of each Church. For, in the cauſe of <hi>Arius,</hi> this power was in the Council of <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and in no leſs. Had <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> looſed him, whom the Synod had bound; though at
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48725:30"/> the inſtance of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> they had been ſinners to God and to his Church, in violating the Unity thereof; which hee hath made more inviolable then any temporal endowment of it.</p>
               <p>How far are wee now, from having evidenced the Viſible Unity of Gods Church to bee a part of the common Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;<note place="margin">The Church Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Haeretickes and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.</note> ſuppoſing theſe things proved, the proofes whereof have no way been inſringed? Haeretickes are condemned by themſelves, ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe they know they forſake that profeſſion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were baptized members of the Church.

If other Biſhops, and their Churches, duely informed from <hi>Titus,</hi> do the like, then is the Viſible Unity of the Church viſible in their proceedings. If they do not the like, then muſt they break communion with <hi>Titus</hi> and his Church; by a perpetual Rule of the Church, holding all Excommunicate, that ſhall acknowledge an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate perſon to bee a member of the Church. But wee read of no breach in the Church, for any of thoſe whom the Church hath declared Haeretickes; Except what ſhall by and by bee excepted. Thus far all the Church owneth the Viſible Unity of the Church. As for Schiſme, how many occaſions of it have been prevented? The difference about keeping <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> the difference about rebaptizing Haeretickes; Many other differences have threatned breaches in the Church, which have been prevented, through the conduct of Chriſtian Prelates. Other diviſions that have come to paſs, have been re-united ſometimes, ſometimes not. The communion of the Church of <hi>Sardinia</hi> with the reſt of the Weſtern Churches ſtood inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, by the diſcontents of <hi>Lucifer</hi> Archbiſhop there; And therefore, I conceive, for his time and no more. The Church of <hi>Antiochia</hi> ſtood divided within it ſelf, under two Biſhops, for a mater of threeſcore years; till, by the interceſſion of the Weſt as well as of the Eaſt, it was re-united. The Eaſt, under <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſtood divided from the Weſt, under <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the cauſe of <hi>Acacius,</hi> for ſome ſeventy years; till the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſatisfied. How long the Schiſm of <hi>Montanus</hi> laſted, (for at the firſt it was but a Schiſme, if wee judge by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> who is the beſt record that remains of it) I ſay not.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48725:30"/> It ſeems to have turned into an Haereſie firſt, and then to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as other Haereſies have done. The Schiſme of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians (for it was no more) ſeems to have returned to the Church by pieces. And ſo that of the Meletians. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts ſeem to have continued, till <hi>Africk</hi> was overrun by the Mahumetans. In all theſe breaches, what ſignifies the attribute of one Catholick Church, but a Viſible Unity oppoſite to ſo many viſible Apoſtaſies? St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that if a ſtranger asked an Haeretick or Schiſmatick the way to the Catholick Church, hee durſt not ſhew him the way to his own Church; becauſe the title was not queſtionable. Not meerly becauſe the Catholick had more belonging to it; (as ſome would have us judge of Religion by counting Noſes) but as <hi>Optatus</hi> ſaith, <hi>quia rationalis, &amp; ubique diffuſa;</hi> becauſe the due reaſon, why men are Chriſtians, ſwayed men to ſtand to the unity of the Church all over; The undue reaſon, that moved men to break with it, prevailed but here and there. At all hands, diſcounting Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes and Schiſmatickes; whom they that follow do ſeldom approve; ſo many Chriſtians, ſo many witneſſes of one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, which, by being Catholick, was alwaies, and muſt needs bee Viſible. And thus far wee have the ſame evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for one Viſible Church, as for the reſt of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>After the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the reputation of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> held<note place="margin">The breaches that have come to paſs evidence the ſame.</note> entire in the Eaſt, notwithſtanding the Decree of the Council. The Records of the Church have preſerved us no intelligence, how, or by what means. Thoſe that write of the Wars of the holy Land afterwards, repreſeut us the Neſtorians in the Eaſt ſo numerous, as might well ſtumble thoſe that pretend to decide the Controverſie of Religion by the Poll, in our Weſtern parts. But, whether the breach ſtood upon the opinion, or upon the perſon of <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> is more then I am able to decide. For in <hi>Aegypt</hi> likewiſe, after many troubles about the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> and the condemning of their Biſhop <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> by it; at length theſe Churches are counted <hi>Jacobites,</hi> from the name of one <hi>Jacobus Zanzalus,</hi> or little <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> who is ſaid to have taught them the poſition of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> condemned by that Council. Whether ſo, or whether a fond zeal for the reputation of <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> hath ſerved to divide that people from the Church,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48725:31"/> upon a meer difference in terms; the breach ſtill continues, and the Abyſſines, depending alwaies upon the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> are ſaid to continue in it. Since that, what breach of intercourſe and communion hath fallen out between the Greek and Latine Church, or upon what cauſe, and how far it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, I need not relate. But there can bee no queſtion, that it diſpoſed theſe Weſtern parts to that breach, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hath made. Within the Reformation, I need not ſpeak of the Diviſion between the Calviniſts on the one ſide; and the Lutherans in the Empire, the Arminians in the Law Countries, on the other ſide. I am only this to demadn; did ever any of theſe parties declare that the Viſible Unity, which theſe breaches interrupt, is not Gods Ordinance? That one of the Parties is not always guilty to God, for the miſchief of Schiſme? That Chriſtian charity is not highly concerned, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating that Communion which Chriſtianity enacteth? Until the dregs of our times, I do not know that it was ever Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, that Chriſtians are not bound to bee members of one and the ſame Viſible Church. I have already ſaid, that the Reformation was not made by common conſent. I muſt now acknowledg futher, that it proceeded not expreſly upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one Viſible Church; though neither denying nor queſtioning the ſame. No marvel then, if in all things it bee not confined to the conſequences of it. And therefore, no marvel, that diſſentions have fallen out in it. No marvel that they, who dare not look ſo clear a principle in the face, can wrangle out the ſalvation of ſouls upon pety ſcruples, which the admitting of it muſt needs preſently diſperſe.</p>

For if the Church bee a Viſible Body, it muſt bee viſible by the Lawes which it uſeth. And, if it bee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one and the ſame Body from the firſt to the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord, the Lawes of it will neceſſarily change, as the Lawes of all Bodies do; but the authority whence they proceed muſt needs continue the ſame. If corruption and abuſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48725:32"/> bee to bee Reformed, and thoſe in whom the authority viſibly reſteth, agree not; Reſtoring that which was, you have the Authority of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, for the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their acts; Introducing that which was not, you go by the ſpirit of the Fanatickes, the dictate whereof appears not in the Scriptures, by the conſent of the Church. In fine, mater of Faith is, to the worlds end, the ſame that the whole Church hath always, from the beginning profeſſed. If you impoſe more, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will have a better pretenſe then you can have; namely, a better claim to the authority of the Church. For it is an impoſture to induce any man to think, that, profeſſing Chriſtianity, they can renounce the Scriptures. The iſſue is, and will bee, whether you or the Church ſhall be judge; Untill you diſtinguiſh between the preſent Church and the Whole Church; not conteſting the Faith of the preſent Church, ſo far as it holds with the Whole. But, in mater of Church Law, which, for the reaſon that hath been ſaid, is neceſſarily changeable; though the difference of times, and the eſtate of things, will not indure the reſtoring of Primitive Diſcipline; yet ſhall it bee eaſie thereby to diſcern, what is abated for Unities ſake, what is rejected, becauſe the Catholick Church and the Lawes of it are not owned.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe terms, it will bee eaſie to anſwer all demands,<note place="margin">No change, without regard to the Rules of the Catholick Church.</note> not only here, but at the great day of Judgement; at which, otherwiſe, the account cannot bee clear. They that would have it thought, that the miſchiefs which wee have ſeen have not been acted for nothing, would have the Law of the Kingdom, in mater of Religion, changed to give them content; without conſidering what cauſe wee give the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to take us for Schiſmatickes, balking the Whole Church, that wee may bee reconciled to thoſe that have broken from us. For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing for the preſent, though not granting, that all Papiſts are Idolaters, and the Pope Antichriſt; The Unity of the Church, is nevertheleſs, as it hath been proved, a part of Chriſtian truth. Nor can Papiſts bee Idolaters, or the Pope Antichriſt, for beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which the Whole Church beleeveth; for command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or for practicing that, which the Whole Church hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or practiced. Nay, not for that, which the Whole Church of any age hath allowed part of the Church to practice.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48725:32"/> For, God forbid it ſhould bee ſaid, (which it were ſenſeleſs to imagine) that part of the Chriſtian World ſhould own part of it for Chriſtians, being indeed Idolaters, and Partizans of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. The Church muſt have been utterly loſt in that caſe; and the Reforming of it muſt not bee the mending of the old Church, but the making of a new Church. Yet is it not enough for theſe men, to allege the antient Church in any particular. They muſt <hi>weigh by their own Weights,</hi> and <hi>mete by their own Standard,</hi> if they will not fall under Gods curſe. They that ſtand not to the conſent of the Church in all things, anſwer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they allege it. Nay, they may invite us to bee Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes for their ſakes, in that, for which they truly allege the antient Church. A juſtifiable, nay a commendable cuſtom of the antient Church may come out of uſe, without any violence, any fraud, any purpoſe, to defeat that pious intent, to which ſuch a cuſtom was inſtrumental. They who had rather break with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then comply with a change, which the change of time, and the ſtate of things by time, hath brought to paſs, ſhould bee, in my opinion, Schiſmatickes. But, what if our Fanatickes ſhould bee content, ſilently to return into the communion of this Church, as Presbyterians? What if it appear, that they are Bullion Haeretickes, for the poſitions they profeſs; though not ſtamped by conviction, and contumacy ſucceeding, and the Declaration of the Church upon that? It will not then bee clear how wee ſhall wipe off that imputation, to which wee ſhall bee liable by the perpetual Rule of Gods Church; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and communicating with thoſe that have ſtamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Schiſmatickes as Schiſmatickes, thoſe that have declared themſelves Bullion Haeretickes, as Bullion Haeretickes; without any ground to preſume that they are changed. Certainly, wee cannot allege the Catholick Church for our ſelves, but it will riſe in judgementagainſt us, when wee ſtick not to it.</p>
               <p>What condition wee fall into, if wee ſubmit to the Church<note place="margin">Regular autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the means of unity; abſolute, of Schiſme.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon terms of conqueſt, it is manifeſt enough. For, wherein the Pope hath not limited his own authority, by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wee render our ſelves to the mercy of it. Miſſionaries ſhall have done a great effect, if they perſwade us that wee are Schiſmatickes, unleſs wee return to thoſe abuſes, which wee ſee with our eyes, which wee handle with our hands, they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48725:33"/> are ſo evident and ſo groſs. Well may they perſwade ſimple Chriſtians, that they muſt firſt reſolve which is the true Church, and then, what is true and what is falſe in Religion, by that which the Church, ſo reſolved, teaches. This is a great deal the ſhorter way, then to juſtifie the particulars, which by this means, they impoſe upon them. And if wee render our ſelves upon theſe terms, what remains, but that wee admit whatſoever the Pope ſhall impoſe for the future; though wee know, that the Power of the Whole Church extends not to it? Which, how ſhall wee anſwer at the Day of Judgement, either for our ſelves, or thoſe that depend upon us? And yet I have ſhewed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, and ought to have, when it ſhall pleaſe to hear reaſon, a regular pre-eminence over the reſt of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in theſe Weſtern parts. And, hee that is able to judge, and willing to conſider, ſhall find that pre-eminence the only reaſonable means, to preſerve ſo great a Body in Unity. And therefore, I count not my ſelf tied to juſtifie <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. in diſclaiming all ſuch pre-eminence; when it was enough for his purpoſe, to diſown it, as not extending to his caſe. For, by the regular conſtitution of the Church, which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, if the Pope excommunicate any man injuſtly, he does it in his own wrong; hee excommunicates himſelf thereby, from all that ſhall adhere to him whom hee excommunicates. His advantage is only this; If more adhere to the chief Church then to the leſs. For which, though there bee regularly a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; yet, if Uſurpation appear, either in ſentencing, or in the mater, or in the effect of the ſentence, hee that exceeds his authority breaks it upon him that exceeds not; like the waves of the ſea againſt a rock.</p>
               <p>But, of the Uſurpations of that Church, wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,<note place="margin">How wee are viſibly one with the only Church of God, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

In the mean time, what I have ſaid of this point, I muſt ſay of all maters in difference; That, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot hinder us of reſtoring our ſelves to the Primitive Right of the Church, by which a Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, duely may maintain the Service of God; (neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the abuſes which other Churches maintain, nor breaking with them in other maters) ſo are wee to go no further,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48725:33"/> then the conſent of the Church will bear us out. For if we make new and private conceits, of the Scripture, and the ſenſe of it, Law to the Church, which wee Reform, wee found a new Church, upon that Chriſtianity, which the only Church of God never owned. But if wee only reſtore that, which, by abuſe of time, may appear to have come to decay; wee impe and ingraffe the Church which wee Reform, into that only Church, which they that Reformed not ſucceed. For how ſhould wee depart from Unity with that Church, the authority whereof wee follow in the change which wee make? If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>wee are to bee without offenſe to Jewes and Gentiles, and to the Churches of God;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands; then are wee to bee without offenſe alſo to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now it is no offenſe to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that wee build Unity among our ſelves upon an oppoſition to the abuſes of it. But, if upon an oppoſition to that which it holdeth from the Whole Church, wee give them cauſe to take us for Schiſmatickes, as not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing in her, the Whole Church, which wee are bound to hold with.</p>

For, I grant it a thing too difficult for every Chriſtian, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48725:34"/> to chuſe his Communion, to try the particulars in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie by the conſent of the Church.

For, without trying the particulars in Controverſie, how ſhall it appear where the Word is preached, where the Sacraments are miniſtred as they ſhould bee? And how ſhall they bee tryed, but by the Scriptures, expounded according to the conſent of the Church? As for them that would have us take the decree of the preſent Church to bee Infallible; they are firſt to tell us, upon whoſe credit wee take that Infallibility. For, you ſee, wee believe not the preſent Church that it is the Church; to wit, founded by God. Wee accept it upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole Church. Neither is any thing Infallible in Chriſtianity, but upon the ſame ground. It is not the decree of the preſent Church, but the witneſs and agreement of the Whole Church, that renders any thing Infallible. Now, it is true, every Chriſtian hath the Judgment of diſcretion, in the choice of Religion, <hi>in point of fact;</hi> That is to ſay; ſuppoſing the diviſion, or rather the diviſions that are on foot in the Church. But <hi>in point of Right,</hi> it ought to bee otherwiſe; God having provided the Unity of the Church, on purpoſe, that ſimple Chriſtians might not bee put to ſo hard a choice. For, when the Catholick Church was ſo Viſibly diſtinct from all Sects, that a Sectary would have been laughed at, had hee called his own Church the Catholick Church of that City; Willfully muſt hee periſh, that ſhould forſake that Church, which hee could not miſtake. But in our caſe, what avails it to allege the Title of Catholick, while the ground of the Title remains diſputable? Eſpecially, the diviſion between the Greek and Latine Church having rendred it almoſt inſignificant afore: And the number of Proteſtants, as I ſaid of <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> rendring it queſtionable, where the ſignification will light.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, that the malice of man, by dividing the<note place="margin">The duty of all eſtates, for the re-uniting of Schiſme.</note> Church, rendreth it <hi>Inviſible, as hard to bee ſeen;</hi> though not <hi>Inviſible, as not poſſible to bee ſeen;</hi> What remaineth, but that all publick perſons, and whoſoever is intereſſed in the diviſions of the Church, underſtand and conſider what account they owe,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48725:34"/> for the Souls that muſt needs miſcarry, by the diviſions, which they maintain wheu they need not? For how ſhall hee bee clear, that profeſſes not a deſire of condeſcending to all that which truth will allow, on either ſide, for the advantage of peace on both ſides? And ſeeing neither ſide can make peace without the conſent of both, but either may have truth alone; What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, but that all Reformation bee confined within thoſe bounds, which the Faith and the Law of the Catholick Church fixeth? For, though they that profeſs and intend to Reforme by that Rule may fail, in applying their Rule to ſome matters; Though, ſeeing what the Rule requires, they may bee fain to abate of it, becauſe the Body which they intend to regulate is not capable of the ſtrict Rule; Yet it is a reaſonable ground of confidence, for a ſingle heart, that the right Rule is expreſly profeſſed to bee intended. For, though in all diviſions, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, acknowledging One Viſible Church, muſt needs hold the one the other Schiſmaticks, unleſs they will bear the blame of the diviſion themſelves; Yet is there no appearance in reaſon, that God will take them for Schiſmaticks, that follow ſo fair a profeſſion in general, though it may not come to effect in ſome particular.</p>
               <p>And this is the only way, to provide a clear diſcharge for the<note place="margin">The ground and extent of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power in Church maters.</note> Secular Power, that is Sovereign; in eſtabliſhing ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by Law, to the people of it, and enacting the ſame with ſuch priviledges and penalties, as Chriſtianity either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth or requireth. For it is manifeſt, from the premiſes, that the Church, by Gods Law, is Judge in the matter of all Lawes, according to which, Religion is to be enacted by any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. Yet is the Sovereign Power Judge alſo of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as not only it ſelf, a Member of the Whole Church, and Heir to all right, which the Unity thereof intitleth any Chriſtian to; but as Protector of the Church, and of the Faith, and Lawes of it; That is, as Protector of all Subjects within the Church of the reſpective Dominions, in all right, which the Law of the Church in the Dominion thereof ſetleth. And therefore bound to judge, whether that which the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the reſpective Dominion, or united with the ſame, ſhall determine, bee ſuch, as the Uuity of the Whole Church either alloweth, or requireth; or not. For, it is onely the Sovereign
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48725:35"/> Power, that can enact it for a Law upon all the Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the effect of Secular priviledges or penalties.

And yet, Gods Law having provided the Church, to limit all matters queſtionable upon the conſtitution of the Church; It is alſo manifeſt, that all Secular Power is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Faith of the Church, as always the ſame from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: And the Lawes in being, as acts of the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was founded by God in the Whole Church from the beginning, before any Secular Power was Chriſtian; Which if it protect not, why is it Chriſtian?

The diviſions of Chriſtendome, which I alleged afore, make full evidence for this. For what need further diſpute
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48725:35"/> about Religion, were Subjects, as Subjects, by Gods Law, bound to ſtand to the will of their Sovereigns, in that which concerns them as Chriſtians? This ſhews, how much Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns are concerned, for their diſcharge to God, to ſeek the peace of Chriſtendome. For, if, as at preſent, it cannot bee had upon juſt terms, it is not the opinion of this or that Divine; It is not the opinion of any perſon whatſoever, not acting in a quality capable, by the conſtitution of the Church, to oblige the Church reſpective to the Sovereign; Much leſs is it his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal skill in matters of Religion, (though as great as any mans) that can ſerve for his diſcharge to God. Hee is anſwerable to God, notwithſtanding any ſuch adviſe, for any wrong, that the priviledges and penalties otherwiſe enacted may do. But maintaining, firſt the expreſs profeſſion of the Rule hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſtabliſhed; bounding all Reformation of the preſent Church, by that which the conſent of the Whole Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alloweth, or requireth; Then, maintaining them in their Office, whoſe Office it is, to forme that, which his act muſt make Law to his Subjects; There will need no more for his diſcharge to God, then the uſe of that Judgment which God hath endowed him with, to diſcern, whether the Rule which hee protecteth bee duly applyed to that which hee enacteth, or not. For as no reaſon can bee excuſed to God, tranſgreſſing that which it ſeeth; So, in things doubtful, to preferre any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before that which God truſteth, in the matter of ſuch truſt, is to render a mans ſelf accountable to God, for that wrong which may bee done; for which, otherwiſe, thoſe that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by God ſhould bee accountable.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt I muſt now profeſs, that the weightieſt point, in re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Difficulty in receiving the Fanaticks into this Church.</note> the breaches of Religion in this Church, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon which, the Fanaticks may bee, either reconciled to it, or ſhut out of it; whether with free exerciſe of their ſeveral Sects, or under certain penalties, as Recuſants. I ſee that they are not afraid to pretend a further liberty, of Publick Preachers, even ſince the Lawes of this Land were in force. For I find that ſuch of them, as are not Miniſters of Congregations, do, notwithſtanding, ſtile themſelves <hi>Publick Preachers.</hi> Which is nothing elſe, then to pretend that authority, from the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power, which they had by the late Uſurpation; to ſeduce as many of his Majeſties Subjects as they can to their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. But that I will ſay nothing of, becauſe I make certain account, that, whenſoever wee come to any ſettlement in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they will find that their pretenſe to bee vain. That which I inſiſt upon is that, which, I conceive, I have proved; that the poſitions which they notoriouſly challenge are down-right Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie; wanting only conviction, to produce, either converſion or contumacy: and the declaration of the Church upon the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48725:36"/> ſame. For it is notorious, that they challenge the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of Gods Spirit, and the certainty of Salvation for the future, upon no further conſideration, then of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; As not depending upon the Chriſtianity which they either profeſs or perform. So far they are from acknowledging, that it dependeth upon their being Members of Gods Church, by living according to that Chriſtianity which it profeſſeth. For, becauſe they think themſelves Members of Chriſt, before they bee Members of Gods Church; Therefore they think themſelves enabled by God, to divide the Church <hi>in infinitum:</hi> And, that the Conventicles of their Congregations are Churches to the ſame effect, with thoſe which were founded by the Apoſtles; Though they profeſs not the Faith, though they renounce the Unity of one Viſible Church. Therefore they openly allow thoſe who maintain, that <hi>God can ſee no ſin in his Elect;</hi> That <hi>their ſins are pardoned from everlaſting,</hi> before they bee done; That God ſhall not judge by our works, but by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; That there are Inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt without the Word, though not againſt it; for dear Members of Chriſt, and the cream of Chriſtians. And hence comes the everlaſting diviſions which they maintain. For, to renounce thoſe bounds, which the Faith of the Church, and the Unity thereof fixeth, is enough to commend them to all parties that do ſo, for the Godly. In fine, the whole fry of this errour reſolves it ſelf in two Poſitions; That God praedeſtinateth to Salvation, meerly in conſideration of mens perſons, and not of any Chriſtianity, which they ſhall bee found to have profeſſed and performed: And, that the knowledge of this Praedeſtination, revealed by the Word, and ſealed by the Spirit, immediately, not ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Chriſtianity which they profeſs and perform, is that Faith which only juſtifieth.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay that the Presbyterians do expreſly profeſs theſe<note place="margin">How their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions deſtroy the Faith.</note> Poſitions. For they have an expreſs Confeſſion of their Faith, which expreſſeth them not. But ſeeing them, in all occaſions of publick confuſion, render themſelves conſiderable by theſe Fanaticks, as being of one and the ſame party; I muſt take it for granted, that they think their Profeſſion reconcileable with theſe Poſitions. Eſpecially knowing how many particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and Preachers of that party, have maintained the ſame;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48725:37"/> Namely, all that maintain juſtifying Faith, and the Knowledge and Aſſurance of a mans Salvation, without and before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. I do not then ſay, that the belief of abſolute Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is Haereſie in the ſight of God. Becauſe it may bee held with other poſitions, which are an antidote to the venime of it, as being really contradictory to it; Which contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did thoſe that hold it perceive, they could not hold it. For, this contradiction ſuffers not the conſequence of Haereſie to take effect. But, both poſitions together, I have maintained to bee down-right Haereſie. Neither have I been ſhewed, or of my ſelf diſcovered any reaſon, ſufficient to think otherwiſe. And therefore, I muſt continue to <hi>weigh by my own Weights,</hi> and to <hi>mete by my own Meaſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, that the ground and ſubſtance of Chriſtianity is utterly<note place="margin">Abſolute Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to Glory destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</note> inconſiſtent with the Decree which they imagine, is manifeſt, if any thing can bee manifeſt in Chriſtianity. Becauſe, if there were any ſuch Decree, then could not men be judged at the laſt day; as judged they ſhall bee; by their works. There is no Decree of God that ſhall not bee executed. If God decree from everlaſting, to give glory and torment for everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without conſideration of mens works, then muſt hee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch conſideration, give it in time. For otherwiſe, hee ſhould not execute that which hee decrees. And indeed, ſuch a Decree can no way bee undefeaſible; as all Gods Decrees muſt bee; Unleſs God determine and move every man, to every thing that hee doth, every moment of his life, upon the account whereof hee ſhall bee ſaved or damned; And that before his own will determine or move it ſelf. But if God ſhould ſo determine and move mans will, then would the tender of the Goſpel bee a meer abuſe, and a mockery; Inviting mankind to Salvation upon a Condition, which, unleſs God determine and move him to perform, hee cannot; If hee do, hee cannot but perform. The juſtice of Gods proceedings, at the laſt day, ſtands upon this; That a man might have tranſgreſſed that, for which hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or puniſhed: And the obligation of Chriſtianity in this; That, by the help which it tendreth, a man is able to do that which it requireth. Again, if wee may bee aſſured of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our Chriſtianity, (the endowment of Gods Spirit here, and everlaſting Salvation in the world to come) before wee bee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48725:37"/> aſſured that wee have performed it; How can wee bee obliged, either to profeſs or to perform that, which, it is to no effect, either to profeſs or to perform, if the effect bee had, without either profeſſing or performing it? For, I challenge the common reaſon of men, to queſtion this; That no effect can depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any condition, which a man can bee ſure of, before hee bee ſure, whether hee have the condition or not. So that, hee that is ſure of his Salvation, before hee bee ſure, whether hee bee a good Chriſtian or not, cannot think it a condition neceſſary to Salvation, that hee bee a good Chriſtian. And therefore muſt needs think, that hee may bee ſaved, without being a good Chriſtian. Nor will it ſerve the turn to ſay, that hee is not therefore ſaved without being a good Chriſtian; Becauſe, if hee bee ſo aſſured, hee is alſo aſſured, that God will make him a good Chriſtian. For in that caſe, Chriſtianity would not bee the condition upon which Salvation; and therefore the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Salvation; ſhould depend. But a mean, by which God would ſave him, whom hee ſhould decree to ſave; upon no condition of being a Chriſtian. Whereas, if Chriſtianity bee true, and if God ſhall judge us by our works, wee muſt bee ſaved by performing that Chriſtianity which wee are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>For I muſt here begin, where I left afore; when I ſaid, that<note place="margin">Juſtifying Faith includeth the profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> they who define juſtifying faith, without including the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity in it, do miſtake the very ground of the Chriſtian Faith. No man can bee a Diſciple of Chriſt, (that is, a Chriſtian; For they who were called Diſciples of Chriſt afore, were called Chriſtians at <hi>Antiochia</hi>) without taking up Chriſts Croſs; That is, profeſſing to dye for Chriſtianity, if it bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; If not, to forgo any advantage of this world, which a man cannot hold, doing the duty of a good Chriſtian. It is manifeſt, that it is not the inward belief of the heart, but the outward profeſſion of the mouth, that rendereth a Chriſtian liable to Chriſts Croſs. For, could a man bee ſaved denying Chriſt, there were no cauſe why hee ſhould ſuffer for Chriſt. Seeing therefore that Chriſt manifeſtly requires a Chriſtian to take up his Croſs; it is manifeſt, that Juſtification, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity promiſeth, is not to bee had without profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Who ever beleeved it, but the diſciples of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48725:38"/> the Gnoſtickes; that would needs go for Chriſtians with Chriſtians, but do as Jews or Gentiles did, to avoid perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Jews or Gentiles. <hi>With the heart a man beleeveth to righteouſneſs,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Good reaſon. For, hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, that God ſent our Lord to preach that righteouſneſs which Chriſtianity profeſſeth, muſt bee a ſtrange creature, if hee find not himſelf obliged to the righteouſneſs, which God ſent him to preach. But it is inherent righteouſneſs, to which, the belief of Chriſts meſſage and commiſſion induceth. That righteouſneſs to which ſalvation belongeth, by that poſitive will of God which his Goſpel declareth, is an attribute which the ſaid gracious will of God alloweth, when the worth of inherent righteouſneſs cannot challenge it. Therefore, <hi>with the mouth a man profeſſeth to ſalvation,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The poſitive Will of God hath tied the promiſe of ſalvation for the future, and juſtification, (the title to ſalvation) for the preſent, to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive act of profeſſing Chriſtianity; not to the perpetual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all righteouſneſs. And therefore this profeſſion was not neceſſary, till our Saviour commanded to <hi>baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> at his going out of the world. Not that, before that time, the Diſciples of Chriſt could be ſaved, denying Jeſus to bee the Chriſt. But becauſe, the profeſſion of Chriſtianity was not properly the condition of ſalvation, till the Baptiſm of Chriſt was inſtituted; till the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were commanded to make men Chriſtians, (<hi>teaching them to obſerve all that Chriſt had given them in charge;</hi>) by <hi>baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that, by this precept; wherein, the ſum and ſubſtance of Chriſtianity conſiſteth; the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which our Lord had required, for the condition of his Goſpel, before, was limited to the Faith of the Holy Trinity, for mater of belief; though extending to all that our Lord had taught afore, concerning the life of a Chriſtian. And herewith agreeth the doctrine of St. <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> III. 20. aſcribing ſalvation to baptiſm, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of cleanſing the fleſh, which is the outward ceremony, but of the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, when it is made with a good conſcience; whereby a man ſolemnly undertakes that righteouſneſs which Chriſtianity requires. And hereupon, the belief of <hi>one Catholick Church</hi> becomes a part of the common
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48725:38"/> Chriſtianity: as the founding of it becomes a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of making ſalvation to conſiſt in profeſſing Chriſtianity. For, as it were ridiculous to think, that any man can attain ſalvation, by making that profeſſion, which, out of a good conſcience, hee intendeth not to perform: ſo were it ridiculous to think, that a man ſhould attain the ſtate of ſalvation, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that for Chriſtianity, which the profeſſion of <hi>one Catholick Church</hi> of God doth not allow.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto the conſideration of the name and nature of<note place="margin">The Nature of Faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Scriptures, ſheweth the ſame.</note> Faith, and the attributes and effects that are aſcribed unto it, in holy Scripture. It is certain, that Faith ſignifieth, commonly, the belief of Chriſts Goſpel. It ſignifies alſo, oft enough, truſt and confidence in God; and that through our Lord Chriſt, when the Faith of Chriſtians is meant. But the one of theſe goes before juſtification, the other comes after, and preſuppoſes it. For, who will undertake that all thoſe who believe that Chriſts Goſpel is true are juſtified, though they live not as it requireth? And yet it is plain, that no man is juſtified but he that ſo beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Now, truſt in God is either confidence that God will bee, or that he is reconciled. The Goſpel is ſufficient ground of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that God will be reconciled with whoſoever will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the condition which it requireth. But he that hath this confidence is not juſtified by it, but by undertaking the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it requireth. Therefore hee hath this confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee bee juſtified. For, being once juſtified, hee hath ground to truſt in God as reconciled. But hee muſt bee juſtified before this confidence can bee well grounded. For otherwiſe, it will bee ſo far from juſtifying, that hee will bee condemned for it. There is therefore a third ſignification of <hi>Faith</hi> in holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comprizing the outward act of profeſſing, as well as the inward act of beleeving: And ſuppoſing this outward act of profeſſion limited, by the poſitive Law of the Goſpel, to the Sacrament of Baptiſm. According to which ſignification, the antient Church counted not Chriſtians <hi>Fideles, faithful or beleevers,</hi> till they were baptized. This is in the middle between the other two. For, as belief goes before it, ſo, it is the ground of the truſt and confidence of a Chriſtian. And this, therefore, is that, which all thoſe Scriptures, that aſcribe the promiſes of the Goſpel to Faith, make properly juſtifying Faith. For, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48725:39"/> to the uſe and cuſtom of all Languages, they are aſcribed to belief, bya Metonymy of the cauſe going before; to truſt and confidence, by a Metonymy of the effect following upon it. But this will not hold, till we pitch upon that which comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, as that which qualifieth a Chriſtian for thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. When therefore, the belief of Chriſts Goſpel cauſes a man to take up Chriſts Croſs, in Baptiſme, then hath he that Faith which juſtifieth; though that which prepares to it, and that which inſues upon it, are honoured with the ſame attribute, for being ſo neer of kindred to it.</p>
               <p>But the conſideration of the queſtion which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth,<note place="margin">So doth the State of that queſtion, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth.</note> viſible in the writings of the Apoſtles, ſuffereth no doubt of his meaning, when hee argueth; that <hi>Faith alone juſtifieth.</hi> It is as clear as the Sun at noon, that all his Diſpute is with thoſe Chriſtians, who, having ſubmitted to the Goſpel, could not conceive, that the Law had no hand in juſtifying them, whom they ſaw live according to the Law: And that, by the direction of that Apoſtles themſelves, for the gaining of the Jews. A thing which they diſpenſed with for a long time, till St. <hi>Paul</hi> was conſtrained to declare againſt it, as rooting up the neceſſity of Chriſtianity, and ſalvation by it alone. That this is the ſtate of the Queſtion; all the New Teſtament, after the Goſpels, is witneſs. And therefore, to be juſtified by <hi>Faith alone,</hi> is with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to bee juſtified by <hi>Chriſtianity alone.</hi> And whereas they were all aſſured, that ſalvation was to bee had under the Law; he ſhews every where, that the Fathers, who were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before, or under the Law, were not juſtified by the Law, but by the Goſpel, that was vailed under it; notas Jews but as Chriſtians. And therefore, that the Gentiles which turned Chriſtians were ſaved by the ſame Grace, as beleeving Jews. For as no works, which they were able to do by the light and ſtrength of Nature, were able to bring thoſe that were without the Law, to the ſtate of Gods Grace; no more could the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, by thoſe works which meer nature was able to produce, (as tending no further, then the temporal reward of the Laws of <hi>Canaan,</hi> expreſly promiſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law) render men acceptable to God, for the reward which Chriſtians expect in the world to come. But, by <hi>Heg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48725:39"/> that the bare profeſſion of Chriſtianity, without bearing the Croſs for the performing of it, was enough to ſave thoſe, that ſhould attain to the ſecrets which they taught; debauched and deflowred the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſoon as St. <hi>James</hi> was dead. And therefore, ſeeing that could not bee done in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wee have cauſe to think that they went to work in his life time. The conſideration whereof ſhews, that St. <hi>James;</hi> in arguing that a Chriſtian is juſtified by works, and not by Faith alone; intended to teach, that the profeſſion of Chriſtianity ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth not when it is not performed. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame, in arguing, that a Chriſtian is juſtified by Faith alone, without the works of the Law. To wit, that hee is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by profeſſing Chriſtianity ſo cordially, and with ſo good a conſcience, as to perform it.</p>
               <p>And for this ſenſe of the Scriptures, there is as current and as<note place="margin">The conſent of the Church herein, with the ground of it.</note> general a conſent of all the whole Church, as for Chriſtianity it ſelf; the life and ſoul whereof ſtandeth in it. Shew me any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor approved in the Church, that ever allowed ſalvation without Baptiſme, when it could bee had; (when it could not, the profeſſion of him that deſiveth it is as clear, as if his fleſh were cleanſed) that compriſeth not the taking up of Chriſts Croſs, by profeſſing Chriſtianity, in the nature and virtue of juſtifying Faith; that oppoſeth that Faith which alone juſtifieth to any other works, then thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. But there is no ſuch thing to bee ſhewed. This is every where to bee ſhewed, in all writings any way allowed by the Church; that the juſtification of a Chriſtian dependeth upon the performance of that which hee profeſſeth: And the Promiſes of the Goſpel, which hee attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by undertaking to live as a Chriſtian, upon the good works whereby hee performeth the ſame. And the honour of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity cannot ſtand otherwiſe. There is no ſin which it cleanſeth not. The reaſon is, becauſe there is no righteouſneſs to which it obligeth not. Hee who beleeveth, that our Lord Chriſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation, upon condition of beleeving and living as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, cannot expect that which hee tendereth, without retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which hee requireth. But hee that is overtaken in ſin, by this Faith, can do no more for the preſent, then undertake ſo to beleeve, and ſo to live for the future. Thereby hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes all righteouſneſs for the future. And by undertaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But there is no thing ſo particular to this purpoſe, as thoſe ſayings, whereby the Fathers declare, that a Chriſtian is juſtified by Faith alone, in caſe he dye upon his Baptiſme; If he ſurvive, then, that hee is juſtified by the works, whereby his profeſſion is performed. Of which ſayings, having produced a conſiderable number, I am by them to meaſure the meaning of all the reſt of their writings.</p>
               <p>The Articles of this Church, ſetting forth juſtification by<note place="margin">The ſenſe of this Church.</note> Faith alone, for a moſt wholſome Doctrine, and full of comfort; for the ſenſe of it, refer us to the Homily upon that ſubject. I will not ſay that my Poſition is laid down in that Homily. For there are many Paſſages of it, which ſhew them that penned it, no way clear in that point. Yet there are divers ſentences of the Fathers alleged in it, which cannot bee underſtood to other purpoſe; and other paſſages well agreeing with it. But in the Church Catechiſme, and in the Office of Baptiſme, it is ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down, as will ſerve for ever to ſilence any other ſenſe. And though that which the Clergy ſubſcribeth bee, as it ought to bee, a wholſome Doctrine; to wit, if ſoundly underſtood; yet, that by which Chriſtian people are ſaved, ought to bee that, which the Offices of the Church, and the inſtruction which it propoſeth contain.</p>

Only it ſignifies this reſolution <hi>in the way</hi> not <hi>in the end,</hi> not <hi>made</hi> but <hi>in making, in fieri</hi> not <hi>in facto eſſe.</hi> But, underſtanding the Repentence of a Chriſtian, turning from ſome particular ſin to God, according to the obligation of his Chriſtianity; his being juſtified of that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48725:41"/> ſin, or from that ſin, will, of neceſſity, require and preſuppoſe his Repentance of that ſin. Notwithſtanding, becauſe this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion expreſſeth onely the inward act of Faith to bee the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that qualifieth a Chriſtian for the promiſes of the Goſpel; though it doth not exclude the profeſſion of the outward man; I have laid it aſide, not only as not true, for the reaſons that I have gsven already, but as not ſufficiently expreſſing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of Grace. For it is, therefore, the means to continue thoſe everlaſting Diſputes, about Juſtification by Faith alone, which, the very mention of the outward act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, limited, for the manner of it, to the <hi>Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> utterly extinguiſheth.</p>
               <p>As for the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſeeming to confine<note place="margin">Of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> the juſtification of a Chriſtian to the infuſion of habitual righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs into that ſoul, which, being truly contrite for the ſenſe of ſin, and the offenſe of God by it, reſolves, for the love of God above all, to live as a Chriſtian for the future, profeſſing ſo much by being baptized; It is liable to a two-fold challenge. Firſt, for excluding the poſitive act of Gods Law, which the Goſpel enacteth; by accepting the righteouſneſs of a Chriſtian, as a condition ſufficiently qualifying for the Promiſes of the Goſpel, by Gods original juſtice. Secondly, for excluding the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts obedience from the conſideration, in which a Chriſtian is juſtified, and ſaved, and in a word, intitled to the Promiſes of the Goſpel. A thing which that Council need not have done. For it is manifeſt, that <hi>Pighius, Gropper,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Contarine, Caſſander,</hi> and many others, the beſt ſtudied in <hi>Luthers</hi> controverſies of all that communion, had owned and embraced it for the Doctrine of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and divers other highly approved Authors. Beſides that, including the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme; that is, the outward act of profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; in the condition upon which a Chriſtian is juſtified, it is not poſſible to exclude, either the act of Gods poſitive will, to which the Goſpel engageth him, or the conſideration of Chriſts obedience, from the ſame. And including the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of them, the juſtification of a Chriſtian will of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſiſt in the gracious account of God, accepting of him that is chargeable with ſin, for righteous; though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes in him that habituall righteouſneſs, whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48725:41"/> to live and dye a good Chriſtian. And therefore they alſo, not excluding expreſly that which they do not expreſly include, the worſe Divines they would bee, as to this opinion, the better Chriſtians they are; that is, the leſs they depart from the right Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Haereſie of <hi>Socinus,</hi> which hath appeared<note place="margin">Of juſtification according to <hi>Socinus.</hi>
                  </note> ſince that Council, gives cauſe to believe, that the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs to the juſtifying of a Chriſtian (which the Reformation, for good reaſons, inſiſted upon) was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly underſtood between the parties, as it ought to have been. Hee maketh the belief of Chriſtianity to bee that Faith which alone juſtifieth, in this regard; becauſe hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it to bee true, muſt needs find himſelf obliged, for his ſalvation, to live and dye a good Chriſtian. Which had been a very good reaſon, why juſtification ſhould not be aſcribed to Faith alone. For, if a man bee ſaved by living and dying a good Chriſtian indeed, not by finding himſelf obliged ſo to do; then is hee juſtified by undertaking to profeſs Chriſtsanity, and not by beleeving it; though by beleeving it, hee is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to do. But, as for the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; I do not marvel, that hee who intended to bring in a new Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould make no reckoning of it, in the condition upon which a Chriſtian is ſaved. For it is the Chriſtianity of the Catholick Church, which he that will be ſaved muſt profeſs, if hee mean to bee ſaved by profeſſing true Chriſtianity. And therefore, the profeſſion of <hi>one Catholick Church</hi> is a part of it. And therefore, hee hath found the true conſequence of his own poſition; when hee makes no more of Baptiſme, then of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ceremony, which the Church may uſe or not, at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For, how ſhould any man make any more of Baptiſme, that allows ſalvation before it; and therefore without it? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Socinus</hi> is free enough, in aſcribing the effect of juſtifying, not to the worth of that Faith which beleeveth, or of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to which it reſolveth; But to the meer grace of God, of his own free goodneſs, ſending, by Chriſt, ſalvation to mankind overtaken in ſin, upon the condition of their Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the future.</p>
               <p>The venim of his Haereſie lies in excluding the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Wherein his Haereſic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> of the obedience and ſufferings of Chriſt, either from the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48725:42"/> reaſon, for which God Grants the grace that makes men good Chriſtians, or for which hee rewards their Chriſtianity, with the life of the world to come. The Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> fully acknowledgeth the conſideration of Chriſts merits, in the helps of grace, without which wee are not good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But, in as much as it maketh Chriſtians righteous before God by their habitual righteouſneſs; inſomuch, and ſo far, muſt it needs exclude the conſideration thereof, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition qualifying for everlaſting life. That is, as they expreſly include it not, ſo, they may bee ſaid to exclude it; Though on the other ſide, as they expreſly exclude it not, ſo, they may bee ſaid to include it. But <hi>Socinus</hi> hath plainly taken up diverſe Articles of the Haereſie of <hi>Pelagius;</hi> affirming that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> muſt have dyed, though hee had not ſinned: and that Chriſt came not to cure any ſin, that by his fall is become Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to his Poſterity: Or to procure any Grace, which Original ſin rendreth neceſſary to make us good Chriſtians; But only to aſſure the World, by his Doctrine, and by his example, that God will make good his Meſſage, if wee fail not on our ſide. And having thus excluded the conſideration of his merit, either in declaring the Goſpel, or in performing it; what neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, why he ſhould bee God? This is the Pedigree of this Haereſie, complicated of the Haereſies of <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>moſatenus;</hi> as this later, of the Haereſies of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Artemas,</hi> and of <hi>Sabellius.</hi> For, as <hi>Liberatus,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Carthage,</hi> hath well obſerved, in his Abridgement of the Troubles of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches; Samoſatenus,</hi> denying the God-head of Chriſt, with <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Artemas,</hi> as concerning the Holy Ghoſt, muſt of neceſſity ſay with <hi>Sabellius,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth; that hee is the virtue and efficacy; that is to ſay, a meer notional attribute, of the Fathers God-head.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Socinus,</hi> excluding ſatisfaction by Chriſts<note place="margin">How the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of Satisfaction and Imputation occaſioned it.</note> Obedience, hath expreſly excluded all imputation of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate conſequence of ſatisfaction: and the effect of it, in order of reaſon; but, in nature and being, the ſame thing with it. Now, it appears by the body of his Doctrine, that hee had conceived a deep diſlike of the opinion which I count Haereſie; that placeth juſtifying Faith in beleeving a mans ſelf to bee predeſtinated to life from everlaſting. And therefore
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48725:42"/> underſtood the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, as that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion muſt needs underſtand it; Namely, that men are reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt, (their ſins being pardoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee done, and they adopted to the glory they ſhall one day have) without conſideration of any condition qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it; Which uo man of common reaſon will take to bee the ſenſe of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> or other learned Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that have allowed imputation to righteouſneſs. And therefore, it will bee neceſſary to diſtinguiſh a two-fold ſenſe in the imputation of Chriſts obedience, and the ſatisfaction which it followeth; to wit, according to the effect, to which it is thought that ſatisfaction is made, and imputed, or put to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For, in the opinion which I call Haereſie, the merits of Chriſt are immediately imputed to them, for whom they were intended for righteouſneſs and life everlaſting. But, in the Faith of Gods Church, Chriſts ſufferings are immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to mankind: becauſe, in conſideration of them, God declares himſelf ready to bee reconciled with all that turn good Chriſtians; and accordingly, makes good the promiſes of his Goſpel to them, performing their Chriſtianity. So that, in the ſenſe which <hi>Socinus</hi> rejecteth; which is the ſenſe of our Fanatickes; imputation, as well as ſatisfaction, is immediate and perſonal; in the ſenſe of the Church, mediate, and real, or cauſal; becauſe it is, immediately, to no further effect, then of procuring the Goſpel, to the effect of ſalvation, by the means of that Chriſtianity which it requireth.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Socinus</hi> conſidered the conſequence of this diſtinction,<note place="margin">Upon what grounds bee is to bee refuted.</note> hee would never have put himſelf upon the task, of confining all that is ſaid in the New Teſtament, of <hi>Redemption, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> and <hi>Propitiation</hi> by Chriſt, and by his bloud, to the effect of aſſuring us, that God will ſtand to the Goſpel which hee publiſheth. Hee would never have wreſted the ſignification of all ſacrifices, and types, figuring our Lord Chriſt and his death in the Old Teſtament, to intend no more, then the inducing of us to that Chriſtianity which hee preached, in confidence of that Grace, which hee, for his obedience, is advanced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. Hee would never have declared againſt the Faith of the Holy Trinity, out of a preſumption, that the ſalvation of Chriſtians is provided for, ſetting aſide the God-head of our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48725:43"/> Lord Chriſt, and the ſatisfaction, at which his obedience is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, in conſideration of it. In fine, hee would not have tranſgreſſed the Faith of the Church, had hee underſtood it. But, having before condemned the Pope for Antichriſt, and the Papiſts for Idolaters, and derived this Apoſtacy of the Whole Church from the very death of the Apoſtles; no marvel that hee would not bee confined to the Faith of the Church, that hee could not ſee the ground of it. No marvel that hee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the proſeſſion of the Faith of the Church, by being baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the condition of our ſalvation; knowing that hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Rule of that Faith. No marvel, that they who ſee him in the wrong, in refuting him and his followers, are ſometimes worſted in a true cauſe; becauſe they conſider not, that the puniſhment of Chriſt for our ſins may ſo bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as to make the reward of Chriſtianity due, before, and therefore without the performing of it. Whereas, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſufferings to concern immediately no particular mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the common cauſe of mankind; The immediate effect thereof is the procuring of a new Law, for God to proceed with us by. Which Law, being ſet on foot upon the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> was firſt fully revealed, by the Goſpel of Chriſt; The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law, which man in his original uprightneſs was ſubject to, remaining ſtill the Rule of Righteouſneſs, according to thoſe terms which the Goſpel declareth; Though, for the effect of taking vengeance on us, abrogated, or diſpenſed with, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Chriſts obedience.</p>
               <p>Now, thoſe helps of Grace which the Goſpel tendreth, for<note place="margin">The helps of Grace granted in conſideration of Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> the undertaking, and performing of that Chriſtianity, which it requireth, are alſo granted in conſideration of Chriſts merits, and ſufferings, put to our account, That is, the helps of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace, or the actual motions of Gods Spirit, without which the Goſpel were a meer abuſe, ſuppoſing original ſin; upon the common account of mankind; The helps of following Grace, or the habitual endowment of Gods Spirit, upon the perſonal account of him that is ſaved by Baptiſme. But both kinds preſuppoſe, that the coming of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was to repair the breach, which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had made. Both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Haereſie of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which <hi>Socinus,</hi> in ſome Articles of it, reviveth. And indeed, to deny bodily death to bee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48725:43"/> the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, what is it elſe, but to deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the fleſh to bee the effect of Chriſts righteouſneſs? For, though it is the power of his God-head that ſhall raiſe them again who ſhall riſe to ſhame; Yet, if it bee the Spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, that ſhall raiſe the mortal bodies in which it dwelt here, up to life; is it not the ſin which the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> brought into the world, that firſt brought in death after it? The ſame Spirit of holineſs it is, that our Lord, according to promiſe, ſent his Diſciples in his own ſtead; and ſent it with viſible ſigns of his preſence, to make his word effectual in them firſt, and by them, to the converſion of the Nations. And this means, as no Chriſtian can deny to bee ſufficient, to oblige all the world to bee Chriſtians; So, there can bee nothing wanting on Gods part, to render it effectual with thoſe that embrace it. For it is manifeſt, that the Grace of God works the converſion of all, by ſhewing the world ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon to bee Chriſtians. A thing which can by no means bee done, but by ſhewing them, that they are the cauſes of their own damnation if they bee not. They that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed hereof, it is ſure, would bee perſwaded by concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, not to act according to that conviction; were there no more then conviction of reaſon to turn the ballance. But, when Gods Spirit manageth the motives of Chriſtianity which it ſelf provideth, (for, this conviction conſiſteth in the works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath made good the preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles) what can bee wanting to the efficacy of it? And this is ſignified in the Old Teſtament, by aſcribing the conqueſt of the promiſed Land to God, and not to the ſtrength or valour of his people. So that, whereſoever wee find, that they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of their enemies hands by Gods aſſiſtance, there wee are aſſured, that the powers of darkneſs are not to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Chriſtians, but by Gods Grace.</p>
               <p>And the inclinations of mans heart to evil from the Mothers<note place="margin">And therefore they inferre Original Sin, by the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> womb, the frailty of humane fleſh, and the mortality thereof, are ſo expreſly delivered in the Old Teſtament, that the Jewes themſelves do acknowledge the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion in them. Neither is it poſſible to give any account, of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for the coming of our Saviour, otherwiſe. For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can bee required to convict the world, that the tender
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48725:44"/> of the Goſpel ſhall bee made good to all that embrace or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, might have been, as well without the death of the Son of God, as by it. Therefore the conſent of the Church in this point hath been evidenced againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> not only by the cuſtome of baptizing Infants, but by the Ceremonies which they were baptized with; ſignifying the ejecting of the evil Spirit, to make way for Gods Spirit. Not that it was a Law from the beginning, that all children of Chriſtian Parents ſhould be baptized Infants. For it is evident, that they thought it better to bee baptized at mans age. Becauſe then, they are more able to underſtand what they undertake. But becauſe they never did preſume of the Salvation of any that dyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized. And therefore, ſince the world came to profeſs Chriſtianity, and that the care and zeal, either of Parents, or Miniſters, could not ſo well bee truſted for the preventing of death, by procuring Baptiſme for Infants; eſpecially with that reverence which the Sacrament requireth; it hath been agreed upon, by the ſilent practiſe of Chriſtendome, to baptize all while they are Infants. And this conſent whoſo infringeth, in the overt act of Schiſme which hee committeth, hee involveth a preſumption of Haereſie againſt himſelf. For, what could move a man to ſuch an outrage, who did believe, that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſaveth a Chriſtian to include in it the Sacrament of Baptiſme?</p>
               <p>And thus it remaineth evident, that it is a Covenant of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable<note place="margin">Wherein the Covenant of Grace conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> Grace on Gods part, which his Goſpel bringeth; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it requireth, upon the condition of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that wee live and dye Chriſtians. Firſt, as tendring the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, as well to undertake as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: And then, having performed, as tendring a reward which our performance cannot challenge. And both in conſideration of Chriſt, whoſe merits and ſufferings are free, pure, meer Grace, before all helps of Grace which they have purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p>It is a thing prodigious and deplorable to conſider, that they<note place="margin">That the ſtate of Grace is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſin.</note> who would bee Reformers of the Church ſhould, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, think it no ſtate of Grace that can become forfeit by ſin. As if, becauſe, without daily ſin, Chriſtians do not live; therefore, that reconcilement with God were no recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48725:44"/> that can become void, by groſs and heinous ſin. But, till that which hath been ſaid of Juſtification, and that Faith which alone juſtifieth, bee deſtroyed, there can bee no pretenſe for ſo dangerous a doctrine. That which is granted upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition faileth with it. And it muſt bee a ſecret which the Old and New Teſtament hath not revealed, that ſhall make good our title to Heaven, though wee make not good that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which intitleth us to it. And therefore, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> is perſwaded, that nothing ſhall <hi>ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. VIII. 28. hee ſuppoſeth <hi>us</hi> to bee ſuch as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth all along the Chapter afore. Such as hee found himſelf reſolved to bee: Such as live not <hi>according to the fleſh, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit.</hi> Of ſuch hee might well bee perſwaded, that nothing ſhould ſeparate them from the love of God in Chriſt; Knowing the helps of Gods All-ſufficient Grace to bee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all that ſo live; not to fail, till they receive them in vain. Whence S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that <hi>hee who is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> becauſe the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> which hee hath from God <hi>abideth in bim, and teacheth him all things,</hi> 1 John II. 20. 27. III. 9. hee ſuppoſeth him that is born of God to bee the Son of God; who ſhall bee no Son of God, if hee ſinne ſuch ſins as hee means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſuppoſeth this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction to abide in him;</hi> which abideth not in them that ſinne. When our Lord ſaith to the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, <hi>John</hi> IV. 14. that <hi>whoſo drinketh of the water which hee ſhall give, ſhall never thirſt any more;</hi> hee ſuppoſeth, that the water which hee giveth is not vomited up again; hee oppoſeth this water, ſo drunk, to the water of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, which did make room for thirſt in time. Whereas this water, ſo drunk, ſhall ſpring up to life everlaſting. All Haereſies have the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſound of ſome Texts of Scripture, to ſet againſt the whole ſtream of Scripture, and the current Doctrine of it. Hee that conſiders, how much of the Old and New Teſtament, that which I have ſaid of Juſtification involveth, will think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to meaſure the meaning of two or three Texts by that; not to rack all the reſt to the length of theſe. As for the ſenſe of the Church, ſeeing the conſent thereof is evident, in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which wee are juſtified; It is a part of madneſs, for any man that believes the Unity thereof, to imagine, that any Doctor that held with that Unity can bee found to teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

For, if it come from an aſſurance of a mans Praedeſtination; As if ſuch a one, being once juſtified, cannot incurre the ſtate of damnation by any ſin; Taking that opinion for an Haereſie, I muſt needs take this for a Poſition deſtructive to Salvation. It is otherwiſe with thoſe that make Repentance to go before juſtifying Faith. For it is true, that, if a man have no ground that hee is reconciled to God, till his firſt converſion; hee can have no ground that hee is reconciled to God of any ſin, that hee falls into after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till hee have performed his Repentance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they contradict themſelves, if they imagine; that, being actually in the ſtate of damnation, a man may have that truſt in God which juſtifying Faith ſignifies, before hee turn from his ſin by Repentance. But the worſe Divines the better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

But, if wee ſpeak of the New Law, which the Goſpel of Chriſt enacteth, (S. <hi>James</hi> calleth it <hi>the Law of liberty,</hi> S. <hi>Paul, the Law of the Spirit of life</hi>) it is evident by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that, if it bee not fulfilled, then is Chriſt dead in vain: then do wee receive his Grace in vain; and cannot bee ſaved, but are ſtill in our ſins. For every Covenant, every contract, is a Law to the parties. And, though God need not contract with his creature, which hee may give Law to at pleaſure; Yet, if hee condeſcend to treat and to contract with man, hee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48725:46"/> intends not to abuſe him, by contracting for that which cannot come to effect. Therefore hee doth not contract with him, upon condition that hee ſhall not ſinne; who, born in Original Sin, ſinneth daily. But, upon condition, that, if hee fall into ſin hee return by repentance: and, blotting out his former ſin, by works meet for repentance, proceed in newneſs of life for the future. And upon theſe terms, the Original Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Paradiſe doth not become void; but continueth in force, for the regulating of the righteouſneſs which Chriſtians are to live by, and to aim at. Whether or no, inhaunſed, in conſideration of that great Grace of God, <hi>bringing Salvation to all,</hi> which <hi>hath appeared</hi> by the Goſpel; above that meaſure, which the Original Righteouſneſs of Paradiſe required; I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not yet. But the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon theſe terms, will be the reviving of the Original Law of Paradiſe, as to the effect of attaining and holding the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (a figure corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, as well to the earthly, as to the heavenly Paradiſe) by that outward obedience, which the letter of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law required: And upon theſe terms, the Thief upon the Croſs, dying in the ſtate of Grace, fulfilled Gods Law; Fulfilling all that, which the Covenant of Grace requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him for his Salvation, in that eſtate. And, if there bee ſuch a thing, as Repentance effectual to Salvation, upon the bed of death; which, the Rules of the Church do not warrant us to preſume of, though they oblige us not to deſpair of it; Then, hee who is effectually converted to God, upon his laſt bed of death, hath fulfilled Gods Law.</p>

But it is as eaſie to ſee, that ſome circumſtances may conduce to the performance of our Chriſtianity, that are no part of it; And therefore the Vow of Baptiſme binds not to them. If Marriage ſtand with Chriſtianity, what Chriſtian is forbidden Marriage? Yet ſingle life is the ſafer way to perfection in Chriſtianity. So is the profeſſion of the Clergy, and all the means, of further retirement from the world, then the taking up of Chriſts Croſs ſignifies. And the Grace which our Lord, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> after him ownes, in them that do this, is not a peculiar temper of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48725:46"/> the body, obliging him that hath it to live ſingle, and him that hath it not, to marry; But a ſingular zeal, to wave that which God makes lawful for us, that wee may the better come to his Kingdom. Which, when it proceeds with a ſingle eye, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to it ſelf nothing of this world, but the means of attaining to the world to come; Well may wee bee aſſured of Gods help to perform it, by virtue of that promiſe which the Common Chriſtianity challengeth, intending nothing but the effect of it.</p>

And that this is the beſt reaſon for many actions of holy perſons, ſometimes not condemned, ſometimes commended in the Old Teſtament; which, notwithſtanding, agree not with that perfection which our Lord, by his Sermon in the mountain, preacheth; To wit, that either they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God, in that eſtate, or at leaſt, might ſtand with the ſtate of his Grace. But this is not to ſay, that our Lord, by thoſe Precepts which hee there delivers, introduces a New Law, which obliged not under the Old Teſtament. For I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that under it, the Fathers were ſaved as Chriſtians; that is, by worſhipping God <hi>in Spirit and truth.</hi> But, that there was a two-fold ſenſe in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law: And that, by keeping it according to the Letter, they held the Land of Promiſe; according to the Spirit, though in a leſs meaſure then the Goſpel requires, they attained the world to come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> of good works done by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian works.</note> may bee underſtood to bee grounded, either upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick value, or upon that mark which the Goſpel of Chriſt ſtampes them with, in conſideration of Chriſts merits and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. But that intrinſick value, at which they are valued, by thoſe who make them worth life everlaſting, upon terms of commutative juſtice, riſes upon the account of Gods Spirit, by the Grace whereof they are done. And the Grace of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not granted, but in conſideration of our Lord Chriſt, and his obedience. And therefore this intrinſick value is meerly imaginary, even in the opinion of them that advance it; unleſs they will needs contradict themſelves. For, the value of our Lords obedience is neceſſarily extrinſick to us; to whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48725:47"/> it redoundeth, only by imputation of Grace. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no intrinſick value of Chriſtian works; ſuppoſing the Goſpel to bee that which I have ſaid. For, being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by virtue of Gods Grace, they cannot bee acceptable to the effect of ſalvation, but by the ſame Grace. But the <hi>merit,</hi> or the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> which is aſcribed unto them, being grounded upon that <hi>Grace, bringing ſalvation to all,</hi> which <hi>hath appeared</hi> by the Goſpel; it is not poſſible to imagine, what it can dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the merits and ſatisfaction of our Lord Chriſt. It is true, men may forget their own grounds: as I have ſaid that they do, who would have the works of Chriſtians to merit heaven upon terms of commutative juſtice. And forgetting themſelves, they may contradict themſelves; aſcribing that for debt, to them that do them, which is not due, but upon the account of Chriſts obedience. But ſtill, the worſe Divines the better Chriſtians. For, the truth which they profeſs, if they profeſs it not in vain, ſhall bee an Antidote againſt that pride, deſtructive to the humility of a Chriſtian, which the opinion of a mans own merit produceth. Whereas, they who exclude all conſideration of our works from the great trial of the Day of Judgement, do thereby exclude Chriſtianity out of the heart, as they do the Creed out of the Church. Whereas, they who ſuppoſe groſs and hainous ſins to bee pardoned, before they ſee the fruits of Repentance in works of mortification, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary exerciſes of devotion, with faſting and almes; do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much as their allowance ſignifies, to the murther of that ſoul, which might have been cured, had not their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity made men believe that there needs no ſuch cure. There is an opinion crept into the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other ſide; that imperfect ſorrow for that ſin, which, by Confeſſion, is ſubmitted to the Keys of the Church, ſerves to cure ſuch ſin, how great ſoever: And that Penance is enjoyned, to redeem the debt of temporal puniſhment, to bee paid in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> if not here; as remaining due when the guilt is done away. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the works of mortification are but the exerciſe, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that contrition, which the Goſpel requires, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie a man for pardon of his ſin. And therefore the authority of the Church cannot ſupply the want of that condition, which the Goſpel requireth in him that ſeeks forgiveneſs: But only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48725:47"/> it, by excluding him from the Communion, that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the cure which the Church preſcribeth. Now, this is an opinion which that Church allows, but enjoyns not. And therefore, whether there bee more danger there, by this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or by the other extreme, where all works of mortification are cried down for ſuperſtitious; I leave to the conſcience of diſcreet Chriſtians. The Catholique Church hath uſed the terms of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> in a true ſenſe, and to a good purpoſe: and it were eaſie to ſhew, that the ſame ſenſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, though not enjoyned, by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> even ſince the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> were this the place.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that the obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately<note place="margin">Original Sin is not <hi>Adams</hi> ſin imputed to his poſterity.</note> imputed to any particular mans account; but, firſt to the common account of mankind; and to the account of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, as they are qualified for it, by being good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And now I muſt ſay accordingly; that the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is not imputed immediately to the damnation of any particular; but, to the bondage of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is poſterity. For, no man ſhall bee condemned at the laſt day, but for the works which hee ſhall bee found to have done in the body. And, for what hee ſhall then bee condemned, for the ſame God decreed that hee ſhould bee condemned from everlaſting. So, being become ſlaves to ſin we are ranſomed by Chriſt. But, as this ranſome intitleth us not to life, till wee embrace the terms of it: neither doth this bondage damn us, till wee beome parties to it by our ſins. If this bee true, then doth not Original ſin conſiſt in the Imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; as <hi>Catharinus</hi> held at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> with great applauſe. And indeed, I need not diſpute; that God cannot, in juſtice, puniſh one man for another mans ſin; becauſe you ſee, the poſterity of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the fleſh, is puniſhed for his ſin, no otherwiſe, then it is rewarded for the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and for his righteouſneſs. The intereſt of our common Chriſtianity is ſafe, ſo long as the neceſſity of Chriſts coming, and the reaſon of it, for the cure of the breach which <hi>Adam</hi> made, remains evident and unmoveable.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any difficulty in reſolving the nature of Original<note place="margin">Wherein Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note> Sin; That ſhould drive us to this novelty. All ſin is an act, or an habit, that faileth of that meaſure which Gods Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48725:48"/> Original Sin hath only this peculiar; that, giving the like inclination as other habits do, it is not contracted by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, but by birth. Call this inclination to that which Gods Law forbiddeth <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> and you have expreſſed the whole nature of Original Sin. For, calling it concupiſcence; you make it to bee the want of Original Righteouſneſs; But you expreſs over and above, what it is that ſucceedeth, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, born in Original Sin, inſtead of Original Righteouſneſs; to wit, that diſorder in our inclinations, which concupiſcence ſignifieth.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion only remains; whether Original uprightneſs<note place="margin">What Original Righteouſneſs ſignifieth.</note> ſhall ſignifie only Innocence; or ſupernatural Grace over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. For it may bee ſuppoſed, that man was created, at the firſt, only to the happineſs of this life, upon condition of living according to the Innocence in which hee was created. And there are that have maintained this; though not denying, that God intended to reward this exerciſe of his innocence, with a call to an higher eſtate. The Fathers indeed are of another mind; Moved, perhaps, by the myſtery of Chriſt and his Church, which hee diſcovereth in his mariage with his own fleſh, <hi>Gen. I. 24. Eph.</hi> V. 31. For this ſeems to make <hi>Adam</hi> a Prophet, endowed with Gods Spirit. But, hee that ſhould not think it neceſſary, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould underſtand the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſe of his own words, would not bee tied to that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. In the mean time, the common Chriſtianity, and the ground of ſalvation, ſeems to remain unmoveable, granting; That, by advancing the Covenant of Grace; which was ſet on foot in Paradiſe, ſo ſoon as God promiſed <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> to diſſolve the works of <hi>the Serpent;</hi> God calleth mankind to an eſtate of ſupernatural Grace. And though it may bee diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it could ſtand with the holineſs of God, and the purity of his work, to have made man in an eſtate of meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that is, ſubject to concupiſcence, without ſupernatural Grace to reſtrain the effect of it; yet could it not ſtand with his juſtice, creating man to ſupernatural happineſs (and therefore liable to Damnation, tranſgreſſing the ſupernatural Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which it muſt require) to create him without ſupernatural Grace, neceſſary to the performing of the ſaid righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>To fortifie that which hath been ſaid, I am not to omit that<note place="margin">What good the unregenerate are able to do by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth expreſly to teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> II. 12-16. That they, who are not under Gods poſitive Law, ſhall bee judged, at the laſt day, by the Law of Nature. Which if it bee ſo, then ſhall they not bee condemned for Original Sin. It is not neceſſary, that Chriſtianity ſhould give account; why God thought good to ſuffer <hi>Adam</hi> to bee ſeduced by the Apoſtate Angels: and mankind to bee born in bondage to ſin; why hee ſuffered the greateſt part of it to bee overcome with Idolatry, after hee had ſet the Covenant of Grace on foot. It is enough, that hee found it for his glory, to give ſin this entrance into the World, which hee meant to encounter with that Grace which his Goſpel revealeth; Leaving that which it revealeth not, to bee unfolded at the Day of the Judgement. In the mean time, if they who know not Gods Law are judged by the Law of Nature; They are not judged by the Covenant of Grace, though given all mankind in Paradiſe; becauſe, by corruption of ſin, they were grown ſtrangers to it. Much leſs, therefore, by the Original Righteouſneſs of Paradiſe, ſupplied by the Covenant of Grace. Now, the corrupt inclination of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence extinguiſheth not the light of nature; which, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the difference between that which is good becauſe it is honeſt, and that which is only pleaſant or profitable, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the neglect of that, for either of theſe. Man is ſenſible of his own worth, and the wrong that hee doth it, when hee preferreth profit or pleaſure before the obligation which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth. And therefore, there can no queſtion remain, that hee is able, notwithſtanding Original Sin, to do that which is good for a right reaſon, and a good intent. For, the reaſon of profit or pleaſure doth not always drown, and ſwallow up the reaſon of that which is juſt and honourable. Therefore, hee who makes not the world to come his end, may do that which is truly good for honeſties ſake, and the ſatisfaction of loving it as it deſerveth. But becauſe concupiſcence, which the world is infected with, procureth daily occaſions of oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween right and intereſt; and thoſe ſuch as call in queſtion the worldly eſtate of him, that ſhould reſolve to prefer the right in all things; therefore is not the natural man able to reſolve upon God, for the end of all his doings. His corrupt inclinations
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48725:49"/> betray the judgement, whereby hee alloweth that which is beſt, to the intereſt of his profit or pleaſure. Now, whether thoſe actions which are done upon good grounds, and for a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but, by a man that maketh not God the end of all his doings, are to bee counted ſins or not; I will not Diſpute. Thus much appeareth, that they who are to bee judged by the Law of Nature do not always tranſgreſs the Law of Nature. For, how ſhould they bee judged by that Law, which they cannot chuſe but tranſgreſs?</p>

For, all that God can do is abſolutely poſſible. And God can do whatſoever can bee done. God cannot deny himſelf: And that hee ſhould do, if contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould bee true; or things that deſtroy one another ſubſiſt both at once. Accordingly, whatſoever God ſees is certain, and God ſees whatſoever ſhall bee; ſo, whatſoever ſhall bee is certain, though wee know not what it is. Now I have ſaid, that it becomes not certain, by any decree or motion of God, whereby hee determines the will of man, and moves it to do whatſoever it doth, before it move or determine it ſelf; at leaſt <hi>in order of nature.</hi> Priority in order of nature ſignifieth this; that the motion of free will doth neceſſarily depend, and ſhall neceſſarily follow, upon the precedent determination and motion of God.</p>
               <p>But, things are ſaid to bee neceſſary two ways; ſome are<note place="margin">The difference between neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>conſequent.</hi>
                  </note> abſolutely neceſſary; The neceſſity whereof lies in their cauſe, and the efficacy of it, which cannot bee defeated. And, in as much as every cauſe is before the effect; Therefore this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is called <hi>Antecedent.</hi> Some are neceſſary only upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not of that which goes before, (for the cauſe which createth abſolute neceſſity may bee ſuppoſed) but of ſomething that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon the being of any thing. As, that which a man knows, or ſees to bee, of neceſſity is; becauſe hee could not ſee it if it were not. And ſo, whatſoever is in the world, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is, becauſe wee ſuppoſe that it is. But this neceſſity is not in the thing, (ſpeaking of contingencies) but in that conſequence which the mind frameth, upon ſuppoſing it. And therefore it is called neceſſity <hi>Conſequent,</hi> as the other <hi>Antecedent.</hi> It is not this conſequent neceſſity that deſtroyeth freedom in the will, or contingence in the effects of it; but the antecedent. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is abſolutely neceſſary but God: and that which God

And this neceſſity is the neceſſity of a cauſe that cannot bee defeated; not implying any ſuppoſition of the effect which it produceth, but inferring the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. Therefore natural, and antecedent, and deſtructive to freedom in the will, and contingence in the effects of it. And this is no more then I ſaid afore, why there can bee no abſolute predeſtination to glory or to ſhame, according to the Goſpel, and Chriſtianity; becauſe it muſt come to effect by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining and moving the will, to every ſtep that it maketh toward life or death everlaſting. And that will not ſtand with that free will which the Goſpel ſuppoſeth.</p>
               <p>For, you may have obſerved a twofold freedom, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.<note place="margin">The difference between free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> and from <hi>bondage.</hi>

But ſuppoſing this, tenders him life everlaſting, upon condition that hee accept of the ranſome, which Chriſt hath paid for him: and, renouncing the bondage of ſin, become free to God and his ſervice. And this is an act which his free will muſt do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the condition of that which God does in conſideration of it. The conſideration is the freedom with which it is done; which if it were done of neceſſity, there could bee no reaſon why God ſhould either require or reward it. So, there is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from neceſſity, whereby mankind, though ſlave to ſin by birth, embraceth that freedom from ſin to righteouſneſs which the Goſpel tendereth; though not by the original motion of the will, (which is not in ſlavery unleſs it love the ſlavery which it is in;) yet, by the free motion of it, being firſt moved by the Goſpel to make uſe of the ranſome.

But it requireth, that, it bee never determined till it determine it ſelf. For it availeth not to ſay, that that freedom which God gave man when hee made him was, to do freely whatſoever God ſhould determine him to do freely; as other things neceſſarily do that which God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth them to do neceſſarily. Freedom, and the uſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48725:50"/> is Gods gift. But God cannot give freedom by taking it away: Nor maintain freedom by deſtroying it. No more can hee cauſe the will to do that freely, which hee determineth it to do neceſſarily, before it determine it ſelf. Nor is there any fear of making the creature God, if wee make it able to doe that which God enableth it to doe, without other helps then the ability which hee giveth it. For, what is that ability, that enableth not to doe that which it maketh a man able to do? It is a riddle when it is not underſtood. It is a contradiction when it is underſtood. The ability which God giveth iſſueth from him, as from the Fountain of all ability, every moment of time, which, one and the ſame ſtanding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternity anſwereth. So, the creature cannot act but by the ability which God iſſueth; And therefore continueth Gods creature, as depending upon God, in that which it doth, no leſs then in that which it is. If therefore the will of man cannot act freely by virtue of any motion of Gods, determining it to act, before it determine it ſelf; then muſt it act freely, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that power which God giveth it every moment to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it ſelf.</p>
               <p>True it is, that, being the will of a reaſonable creature, it<note place="margin">The Object de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth the Will, ſaving the freedom of it.</note> cannot determine it ſelf, till it bee determined, <hi>in the nature of an object,</hi> by a reaſon, carrying an appearance of that which is beſt for the preſent. But becauſe that appearance changeth from moment to moment; therefore, the determination of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is never peremptory, till you ſuppoſe the will to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it. And therefore, though it bee neceſſary, that the will act according to the laſt dictate of the underſtanding; yet is this neceſſity, but upon ſuppoſition, that it is the laſt: And that, becauſe you ſuppoſe that the will proceedeth to act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imploying further conſideration upon the object. So, the appearance of good in the object, and the ability of imbracing it in the will, ſerve to make good the freedom of choiſe in humane actions. But, the certainty of it from everlaſting muſt bee aſcribed to the incomprehenſible wiſdom of God, comprehending all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of good, which all men may be moved with, at all times; and the effect, which the preſent diſpoſition of every will ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every motion, at every moment. Now providence muſt needs appoint, from everlaſting, what appearance of good every will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48725:51"/> ſhall bee moved with every moment; by reſolving, what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of objects every reaſon ſhall bee preſented with, in that eſtate, which it ſetleth every man in, for every moment. And upon theſe terms, the foreknowledg of humane actions in God muſt needs bee infallibly certain; ſaving, as well the freedom of the will, as the contingence of the things which it doth. For comprehending, firſt the preſent diſpoſition of every will: and the effect of every motion that is poſſible, upon it; then, not only how it ſhall bee actually moved, but alſo, that it ſhall not bee moved otherwiſe; how ſhould hee fail to comprehend what it will determine, while it might determine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</p>
               <p>And, that this is the true and due way that wee are to hold,<note place="margin">Whence, the certainty of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ariſeth.</note> in reaſoning of Gods Counſels, appears by the whole tenor of the Scriptures, ſpeaking of God in the language of the children of men; as the Jews Doctors ſpeak. It pleaſeth God, not only to deal with man about his ſalvation, but to treat with him in his own Language; becauſe hee is not able to underſtand God otherwiſe. It is not poſſible for us to underſtand the wiſdom of God otherwiſe, then, according to the wiſdom of man; as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, by deliberation to reſolution; though wee know very well all the while, that the ſimple and indiviſible eſſence of the Godhead is that, into which, all variety of his Decrees, which the Scripture obligeth men to order, muſt reſolve. Now the Scripture repreſenteth God to us, every where, as taking the riſe and the ground of his Counſels, and Proceedings, from that which hee ſeeth in the thoughts and diſpoſitions of the men, whom hee ordereth. The inſtance is remarkable, and unavoidable, which you have in the whole courſe of his bringing the people of Iſrael out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the deſtroying of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, for the hardneſs of their hearts, which hee foreſaw, would not let them obey his meſſage, and releaſe his people. The like you have in the raiſing up of enemies to <hi>Solomon,</hi> for his ſin: and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ten Tribes from his poſterity. So, in the deſtruction of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the repreſentation of Gods Counſel, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in it, which the Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> declares before hand to his face. So in the Crucifying of our Lord, and the means whereby it was brought to paſs, according to the Counſel of God, which the Scripture declareth.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48725:51"/>
               <p>True it is, there bee divers paſſages in Scripture, which ſeem<note place="margin">How this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Scriptures.</note> to ſignifie a will in God, that ſuch men ſhould ſin, as hee hath determined to deſtroy; the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> for example, neglecting their fathers advice, <hi>becauſe God had reſolved their ruine.</hi> But, ſeeing it is ſo plentifully expreſſed, in other Book caſes of the Scriptures, that ſuch mens reſolutions came not from the immediate motion of God, determining them to that which they do; but from the conſiderations, which their own prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wickedneſs was enſnared with; all reaſon of Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that the like conſiderations bee ſuppoſed, in thoſe caſes wherein they are not expreſſed. As, that the ſons of <hi>Eli</hi> were not determined by God to ſin, becauſe hee had reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; but that, for their ſins which went afore, hee ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them the advice of their Father, which hee foreſaw they would ſin by neglecting; that is, hee ſuffered them to ſin fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to their own ruine. A thing ſo manifeſt in the caſes of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> that, whoſo ſhall ſtumble at the hardning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, muſt thank himſelf for the fall which hee takes by that offenſe.</p>
               <p>The Scripture expreſſeth further, that, if <hi>Saul</hi> had come to<note place="margin">God no cauſe of ſin, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</note> 
                  <hi>Keilah,</hi> the men of the City would have delivered <hi>David</hi> into his hands. And that, if our Lord had done thoſe miracles in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> which hee did in <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> they would have repented, in ſackcloth and aſhes. Not as if the preaching of the Goſpel, or the miracles which aſſure the truth of it, were Grace ſufficient. But becauſe the Spirit by which our Lord ſpoke, and wrought miracles, was preſent with the words and with the works, which hee uſed, as means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to convert his hearers. And therefore are to bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by virtue of Gods promiſe, when they are not expreſſed. The Book of Wiſdome affirmeth, in like manner, that God foreſaw the impenitence of the Aegyptians, notwithſtanding all <hi>Moſes</hi> his miracles. Theſe paſſages affirm expreſly, that God foreknows what man would do, if hee were in any eſtate poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though indeed hee never come into that eſtate. But this is to bee underſtood according to the incomprehenſible wiſdom of God; comprehending all appearances which a man ſhould bee moved with, in that eſtate: Not according to that which man can underſtand, or expreſs, of any mans caſe, in any eſtate.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48725:52"/> For, all that wee can comprehend, is never able to render the event certain, that is but contingent: and to tranſlate the effect from <hi>poſſible</hi> to <hi>future;</hi> which, the wiſdom of God, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all things, can do.

               <p>THere remains no more but to conclude; that, though Gods<note place="margin">No abſolute Predeſtination to <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  </note> Predeſtination to Glory or to ſhame cannot be abſolute, yet his Predeſtination to <hi>effectual</hi> Grace, or to that which is only <hi>Sufficient,</hi> is and muſt bee abſolute. If Gods predeſtination to Glory and to Shame were abſolute, without conſideration of that for which it is executed in time; there could bee no ground for any exhortation, any advice, any perſwaſion, moving any man to perform any part of that Chriſtianity which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. There would bee always a peremptory bar to all ſuch applications; That, what God hath appointed ſhall come to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48725:52"/> paſs, whatſoever a man ſhall do or endeavour to do. For it would not ſerve the turn to ſay; That, if God have appointed the end, hee hath appointed the means to effect it: And that this means is mans endeavours. Becauſe, if God have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end to come by the means of that which a man is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, then ſhall hee do it, whether hee endeavour to do it or not. For, if it bee ſaid, that hee hath appointed it to come to paſs by mans endeavours; then is not Gods decree abſolute: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt ſuppoſe mans endeavours. And indeed, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decree of predeſtination cannot come to effect, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, determining and moving mans will to that, which the bringing of it to effect requireth, before the will determine or move it ſelf. And that is deſtructive to freedom in the will, and contingence in the effects of it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if the certainty of Gods foreknowledge,<note place="margin">Predeſtination to Grace, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</note> and the Infallibility, or indefeaſibleneſs of his providence ſtand upon a decree, of placing every man, at every moment of his life, in ſuch an occurrence of objects, inward and outward, with his diſpoſition, who is moved by them, to do, or not to do this or that, as hee ſees will bee effectual to reſolve him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which hee doth; then are the helps of Grace effectual, and the effect of them certain, upon the like decree. Which there is nothing in man to oblige God to make: And therefore, it is his abſolute will that maketh it. For, the intent of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, for the redemption of mankind, inferreth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that God will do all that is in his power to do, that it may bee to effect, if man refuſe it not. It is enough, that hee accompanieth the Goſpel with his Spirit, when it cometh; In the mean time, that he truſteth his Church with the bringing of it. This juſtifieth his will, that all men ſhould bee ſaved; though they who never hear of it, for reaſons which the Goſpel declareth not, have not the refuſing of it. Whereby it appears, that the Authors of diviſions in the Church are to anſwer for the ſouls that periſh, for want of knowing the Goſpel; which, the diviſions of the Church are the greateſt means that hinders them to know. Now this decree proceedeth upon a ſuppoſition of freedom in the will, and the maintenance of it, by Gods continual Government of all things; And therefore allows ground for all applications, moving to perform the Chriſtianity
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48725:53"/> which wee profeſs. For, though all that comes to paſs is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Gods decree, that cannot fail; yet that decree is not immediate, but ſuppoſeth mans will to move of it ſelf; when his reaſon is moved by appearance of good in the object. And therefore it cannot bee alleged, in bar, to any wholſome exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or advice. And although all that is thus decreed muſt needs come to paſs; yet the neceſſity thereof is only <hi>conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quent,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition, that the will determines it ſelf freely; which being ſuppoſed, the conſequence is certain, that it ſhall come to paſs. Whereas the neceſſity of that which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth the will to act; lying in the determination and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cauſe, which is God, that cannot fail; is <hi>antecedent</hi> to the effect, and deſtroys the freedom of the will, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence of that which it doth.</p>
               <p>If it bee ſaid, that the end is intended before the means: and therefore, hee that is abſolutely predeſtinated to effectual Grace<note place="margin">How Glory is the end of Grace.</note> (which includes perſeverance until death) muſt needs bee abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely predeſtinated to Glory, which is the end of Grace; the anſwer is. The Glory of him that is ſaved is not the end of Gods Grace; that is, of his Gracious purpoſe, to give thoſe helps which ſhall bring a man to Glory. Gods Grace is God, and Gods Glory is God; And God can have no end but God: and the glorifying of him that is ſaved is not the means to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, till you ſuppoſe him qualified as the Goſpel requireth. And therefore it is not abſolutely the end of that Grace which effecteth it, till you ſuppoſe that it rendreth him ſo qualified. The means by which a man comes to Glory, if you take them as granted in ſuch conſideration, and rewarded in ſuch meaſure as the Goſpel alloweth, are the means of Gods Glory; otherwiſe they make not his Glory to appear, and therefore are not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to that purpoſe. Indeed, God hath made ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the end of mankind, by the work of Redemption, as well as of Creation. But hee hath not made it his own end, nor the means to it, but upon thoſe terms which the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth. All this is manifeſt by the damnation of thoſe that are not ſaved. For, though it bee their final eſtate, yet it is not their end, becauſe ſalvation is the end of all manking; Which were it Gods end, as it is mans end by Gods appointment, then ſhould they alſo bee ſaved. For God cannot fail of his end.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48725:53"/> Therefore is not the damnation of him that is not ſaved the end why God appoints him thoſe means, by which hee ſhall come to that final eſtate. For it is not the means to Gods end, that is his Glory, till you ſuppoſe the man qualified as the Goſpel alloweth: and ſo conſider'd by God, when hee appoints him the means that bring him to his laſt eſtate. In fine, mans Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not Gods end in giving Grace; Though it bee the end of the Grace which hee giveth. Gods Glory is the only end as well of the Grace as of the Glory which God giveth. Gods Glory is the end of effectual Grace. For God intendeth the effect which his Grace attaineth. And effectual Grace is a fit mean to glorifie God; implying mans compliance with Gods help. As for the helps of Grace in general, whether effectual or only ſufficient; though mans glory bee the end of them, and that by Gods appointment, yet is it none of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the mean to Gods Glory, till it bee ſuppoſed, that they are uſed as they ſhould bee. And therefore God doth not appoint any man to Glory, till hee ſee that hee hath uſed his Grace as hee ſhould do. But hee appointeth Grace without ſuch reſpect; becauſe there is no condition on mans part, to render it due.</p>
               <p>And herewith agreeth the Faith of Gods Church. It is well<note place="margin">In what terms the Faith of the Church ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point.</note> known, that St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> writings againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> were excepted againſt, (as introducing fatal neceſſity, and excluding the Will of God for the ſalvation of mankind,) in the parts of <hi>Gaule;</hi> namely, by the Monaſtery of <hi>Lerins,</hi> the Clergy of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> and div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48725:54"/> And thereupon followed a Reſcript of Pope <hi>Caeleſtine,</hi> to the Biſhops of <hi>Gaule,</hi> yet extant; aſſerting the Doctrine of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in divers Articles, though without condemning any perſons of the other ſide. The II. Council of <hi>Orange,</hi> afterwards, with the authority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> decreed againſt the ſaid Articles. But no leſs againſt Predeſtination to death, or to ſin: And, without condemning either <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> or <hi>Gennadius,</hi> or <hi>Vincentius,</hi> or their writings. And therefore, they can no more bee counted <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> for a Sect, then the other ſide <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinarians.</hi> For this new decree, ſuperſeding the former, united the parties, and hath been ever ſince in force in the Weſt, The ſtirs that were afterwards under <hi>Carolus Calvus,</hi> upon the ſame ground, in the cauſe of the Monke <hi>Gadſchalcus,</hi> cannot bee thought to have made any alteration in it; becauſe there were Prelates againſt Prelates, Churches againſt Churches, and Synods againſt Synods in the cauſe. Always, that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil decreed nothing for St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> againſt the redemption of all mankind, and the will of God that all bee ſaved. And <hi>Proſper</hi> his Apologiſt, (and the Author <hi>de Vocatione Gentium</hi> much more) writing about the ſame time, have aſſerted both. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thereby the late zele of <hi>Jonſeinus</hi> for St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> (if not his hatred of the Jeſuites) who, thinking to overbear all Diſpute in the point, by his authority and reaſons, hath not been afraid to maintain him in thoſe Articles. And therefore hath given the Dominicans, whom his opinion ſeems to comply ſo much with, juſt occaſion to joyn themſelves againſt him, with the Jeſuites. But his opinion will prove a <hi>nihil dicit.</hi> That of <hi>Arminius,</hi> as it neceſſarily oppoſes abſolute Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Glory, ſo it ſtands very well with abſolute Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Grace; Becauſe it derives the Efficacy of Grace from that <hi>Congruity,</hi> which, as Gods foreſight diſcovers, ſo his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence uſes. And therefore the diſcreeteſt of his adverſaries, at the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi> the Engliſh, and thoſe of <hi>Breme;</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the redemption of mankind, and the will of God that all bee ſaved. Thoſe that will not do the ſame muſt reſolve upon Predetermination. And that, I grant, is not deſtructive to Chriſtianity in the Dominicans; though of it ſelf it bee deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: Becauſe, holding free will, they contradict themſelves in it, and ſo have an Antidote againſt it.

For, that which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48725:55"/> concerns him as a Member of the Church ariſes from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church; as the effect of that power, which God hath endowed his Church with.

Whatſoever is neceſſary to bee known for the ſalvation of all Chriſtians is of this kind. And whatſoever proceedeth from the power of the Church, as the effect of it, is not neceſſary to bee known, for the ſalvation of all Chriſtians. It is neceſſary for all Chriſtians to know, that they are to live and dye Members of Gods Church; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conform themſelves to the order of it.

It ſeems therefore, that theſe Sacraments concern Chriſtians as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and not only as Members of the Church.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>what preſumption of Haereſie there is, in the Sect of the Anabaptiſts. For, did they think the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to bee the condition, in conſideration whereof, all that are baptized are ſaved; they could not take that Baptiſme of the Church for void, whereby, there can bee no doubt, that a Chriſtian is obliged, to the profeſſion of a Chriſtian. Becauſe they believe not the condition of ſalvation to bee the Covenant of Baptiſme, therefore they make it void, being received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowledg. Whereas the greater queſtion is, whether the Church bee obliged to take their Baptiſme for Baptiſme, or not. For, though the School make good all Baptiſme mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in due mater and form of words; yet the Church never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this general reaſon, why it alloweth the Baptiſme of thoſe

And that, without entring into any diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſubſtance of the Elements; But, ſecuring firſt that which the common Salvation requireth in the Sacrament; to wit, the receiving of the fleſh and blood of Chriſt by it; by imputing the preſence of them to the Conſecration, not to the Faith of him that receives; It condemns the Errour of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> making the change myſtical, and immediate, upon the coming of Gods Spirit to the Elements; the nature of them remaining: But it condemns <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> for no leſs. For, what needs the fleſh and blood of Chriſt fill the ſame dimenſions, which the ſubſtance of the Elements poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, both being united with his Spirit? And truly, they that invite the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to their Communion, profeſſing <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> muſt not make <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> an Errour in the foundation of Faith, if they will <hi>weigh by their own Weights,</hi> and <hi>mete by their own Meaſures.</hi> But, if the Errour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, when they make the aſſurance of a mans Praedeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bee juſtifying Faith, bee an Errour in the Foundation of Faith; as I have ſhewed that it is; Then it is an Errour in the Foundation of Faith, to take the Euchariſt to bee a meer ſign to confirm that Faith: And the fleſh and blood of Chriſt to bee preſent in the Euchariſt, not by the Faith of the Church, whereby the Conſecration is made and done, but by this Faith, in him that receives. And therefore, this Errour being enough to render the Sacraments no Sacraments, which are celebrated profeſſing it; the <hi>Word</hi> no Word of God, that teacheth to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate ſuch Sacraments; the Churches no Churches that profeſs it, or communicate with them that profeſs it; My Inference is unavoidable; That, to juſtifie this Church a Member of Gods onely true Church, they ought not to bee re-admitted into it, without expreſly acknowledging; <hi>The Chriſtianity which wee undertake by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, to bee the condition of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>

For, they are not the fleſh and blood of Chriſt as in his body, while it was whole; but as ſeparated, by the paſſion of his Croſs. Not that Chriſt can bee ſacrificed again. For a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48725:57"/> being an Action done in ſucceſſion of time, cannot bee done the ſecond time being once done; becauſe then it ſhould not have been done before; But, becauſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt crucified is <hi>repreſented, commemorated,</hi> and <hi>applyed,</hi> by celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and receiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is that <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> They of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that would make the breach wider then it is, do but juſtifie the Reformation, by forcing any other reaſon of a Sacrifice out of the Scripture, expounded by the conſent of Gods Church. And they which ſtumble at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> which this Sacrifice inferreth, plainly they invite us to renounce the Whole Church of God, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for their ſakes. And how much Chriſtianity they will leave us, when that is done, who will undertake? Thus much for certain, upon theſe terms, the virtue of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is not to bee applyed, by the ſecret and private intent of the Prieſt, directing his action to the benefit of living or dead; whether preſent or abſent; whether concurring to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and receiving of it, or not ſo much as thinking themſelves concerned ſo to do. It is not applyed, but by the devotion of them, who, either receive it when they are bound to receive, or concurre to the celebrating of it when they are not; whether Prieſts or People. And therefore, there is no ground for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſſes, by granting the Euchariſt to bee in this nature a Sacrifice.</p>

The obligation of that ſenſe, upon the Church at this time, is not to bee meaſured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the primitive practice of the Whole Church.

It is therefore neceſſary that both ſides, profeſſing the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould agree upon the true ground of Reformation; and ſo, upon the Rule which that ground will maintain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that is, to ſubmit all that is in queſtion, to the viſible practiſe of the primitive times, before thoſe abuſes were brought in, which the Reformation pretendeth to reſtore.

And, ſeeing the Church is Viſible by the Lawes of it; there can no Church bee viſibly one with that which was from the beginning, but by ruling it ſelf by the ſame Lawes, ſo far as the ſtate of the Bodies for which they are made is the ſame. That which ſhall bee ſaid, concerning the form of our Service, is an inſtance hereof. The ſenſe of the Scriptures, which have been alleged, ſhall appear to agree with the primitive order of Gods Church. The reviving of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is the point of Reformation in this particular; allowing, for avoiding juſt offenſe, in altering the Law of the Kingdom, without neceſſary cauſe; as the wiſdom of Superiours ſhall find requiſite.</p>

But all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed, that no devotion of the people bee exerciſed by it. The Pſalms in Rhime muſt engroſs that.

More freely by them, who ſang them at the head of their Armies, to that purpoſe. I hope thoſe ways do not pleaſe at preſent; And therefore ſay freely, that the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ought not to continue.

But the Church uſes them, ſuppoſing them all fulfilled in Chriſt and Chriſtians; whether particular ſouls, or the body of his Church. Upon this Account they are the exerciſe of Chriſtian Devotions. But not the Pſalms in Rhime. The muſick of them hath proved too hard for the people to learn, in an hundred years. And yet, no way more commendable then the Rhimes themſelves are: And, repeating a little in much time.

And therefore, are content to know their duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; letting that which agreeth not therewith, in the Old Teſtament, paſs without offenſe.

But I do not grant, either that they cannot bee taught their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without two Sermons every Lords day: Or, that they are like to bee taught their duty, by two Sermons every Lords day. It is not poſſible to have men for all Churches, fit to preach twice a day, to the edifying of the people. It will not bee poſſible to maintain their preaching ſuch, as may bee accompted an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Gods ſervice.</p>
               <p>In the antient Church, for divers hundred years, all that<note place="margin">The difference between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Service in the antient Church, and our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Service.</note> were admitted to ſtay all this while; that is, till the Sermon were done; were not to bee preſent at the Euchariſt, were not to communicate. As <hi>Converts</hi> not baptized, as the <hi>relapſed,</hi> as the poſſeſſed by unclean ſpirits; in which ranck the <hi>Lunaticke,</hi> the <hi>Epilepticke,</hi> the <hi>Frantick</hi> were accounted. And reaſon good; for they were not to communicate, at leaſt till death. And yet they were not to bee diſmiſſed without the prayers of the Church; Prayers fitting their ſeveral eſtates, for their profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or for their recovery, that they might come to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. I will not here undertake, that all which remained did always communicate; though I doubt not, I may undertake,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48725:60"/> that the rule of the Church required them always to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For, when the world was come in to the Church, the Rule that prevailed in time of perſecution, there is no marvel, that it could not then prevail. By St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alone it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently, that the Rule was well enough known; but not in force, even in his time. So, when they that might not communicate were diſmiſſed, they that would not communicate remained nevertheleſs. For, the Euchariſt was not to bee ſet aſide for their negligence. This is the difference between the <hi>firſt and ſecond Service;</hi> which is not the ſame with our <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Service.</hi> For, the firſt Service ended when the prayers of the Church began. Our Communion Service is that which is properly called the Liturgy in Greek: Namely, the Office which the Euchariſt is to bee celebrated with. That which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Offertory</hi> belongs not properly to the <hi>ſecond Service,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive Form; For, the preſenting of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was always, every where, the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>The prayers of the Church began with <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God,<note place="margin">The General Preface, and the Prayers of the Church at the Euchariſt.</note> for making man, and ſetting him over the creatures; for taking care of him after his Fall, teaching the Patriarches, giving the Law, ſending the Prophets; and, when all this did not the effect required, for ſending our Lord Chriſt. From this <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> both the Action of the Sacrament, and the conſecrated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements are ſtill called <hi>the Euchariſt.</hi> And it is called a <hi>Preface,</hi> in a very antient African Canon; to wit, to the conſecration of the Elements which followed; Which, as I ſaid before, is nothing elſe but a prayer, that God would ſend the Holy Ghoſt upon the preſent Elements; and make them the <hi>Body and Blood</hi> of Chriſt; that they who ſhould receive them worthily might bee filled with his Grace. The common prayers of the Church; that is, of thoſe who were admitted to Communion with the Church; were always made at the <hi>Altar,</hi> or <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> in the action of the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſon good. How can Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians think their prayers ſo effectual with God, as when they are preſented at the Commemoration of the Sacrifice of Chriſt crucified; the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> whereof to God, in heaven, makes his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> there ſo acceptable?

But thoſe 144000 that were ſealed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> appear not in the Court of the Tabernacle, but on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> a place of inferior holineſs: And ſing not the Martyrs ſong, but are only able to <hi>learn</hi> it, which no body elſe could do. Sufficient Arguments of difference, in the State of bleſſed ſouls; though all beneath that which the Reſurrection promiſeth; which all of them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire. Suppoſe the place bee the <hi>third Heavens;</hi> ſuppoſe that it is called <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> (becauſe, of neceſſity, it anſwers the Figure of the <hi>earthly Paradiſe,</hi>) ſuppoſe that in reſpect of the Saints that dyed under the Law, it is called <hi>Abrahams boſome;</hi> There may bee <hi>inferior Manſions,</hi> in the mean time before the Ruſurrection, for ſouls of inferior holineſs; though they depart in the State of Grace. For how oft do the Apoſtles ſignifie a ſollicitous expectation of the Day of Judgement, in thoſe whom they ſuppoſe to dye Chriſtians? A thing which can by no means ſtand with the eſtate of thoſe that are before the Throne of God, praiſing him day and night, in the Court of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. And therefore St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had great reaſon to follow the fourth Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> (written, without doubt, by a very antient Chriſtian, though not authorized by the Church) placing the generality of ſouls departed in the ſtate of Grace in certain <hi>ſecret receptacles;</hi> ſignifying no more, then the unknown Condition of their eſtate. For, the practice of the Church, in <hi>interceding</hi> for them at the Celebration of the Euchariſt, is ſo general, and ſo antient, that it cannot bee thought to have come in upon impoſture, but that the ſame aſperſion will ſeem to take hold of the Common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>But, to what effect this Interceſſion was made; that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,<note place="margin">The antient Church never Prayed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them out of Purgatory.</note> the due point of difference. For, they who think that the antient Church prayed, and do themſelves pray for the removing of them from a place of <hi>Purgatory</hi> pains, into perfect happineſs, by the clear ſight of God, offend againſt the Antient Church, as well as againſt the Scripture, both ways. For <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> makes it a part of the Gnoſticks Haereſie, that the ſoul without the body is in perfect happineſs. They indeed held it, becauſe they denyed the Reſurrection. But the Church therefore, believing the Reſurrection, believes no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48725:62"/> happineſs of the Soul before it. And the great conſent of the Antient Church in this point, is acknowledged by divers learned Writers in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither is the conſent of it leſs evident in this; That there is no tranſlating of Souls into a new eſtate, before the great Tryal of the general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time then, what hinders them to receive <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>

And though there bee hope, for thoſe that are moſt ſollicitous to live and dye good Chriſtians, that they are in no ſuch ſuſpenſe, but within the bounds of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Condition is uncertain; and, where there is hope of the better, there is fear of the worſe; therefore the Church hath always aſſiſted them with the prayers of the living, both for their ſpeedy tryal, (which all bleſſed ſouls deſire) and for their eaſie abſolution, and diſcharge with glory before God, together with the accompliſhment of their happineſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of their bodies.</p>
               <p>Now, all Members of the Church Triumphant in Heaven,<note place="margin">The Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted pray for the Militant Church.</note> according to the degree of their favour with God, abound alſo with love to his Church Militant on earth. And, though they know not the neceſſities of particular perſons, without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Revelation from God; yet they know there are ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, ſo long as the Church is Militant on earth. Therefore it is certain, both that they offer continual prayers to God for thoſe neceſſities; and, that their prayers muſt needs bee of great force and effect with God, for the aſſiſtance of the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant in this warfare. Which if it bee true, the Communion of Saints will neceſſarily require, that all, who remain ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of their tryal, bee aſſiſted by the prayers of the living, for preſent comfort, and future reſt. That the living beg of God, a part and Intereſt, in the benefit of thoſe Prayers, which, they who are ſo neer to God in his Kingdom, tender him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, for the Church upon earth. As for prayers for the tranſlating of Souls out of Purgatory; the beginning of their coming into the Church is viſible.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48725:63"/>
               <p>And ſo is the coming in of thoſe prayers, which call upon the<note place="margin">Of Prayers to the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</note> Saints departed by name, in any publique Office of Devotion in the Church. The voluntary devotions of private perſons, moſt of them ignorant and carnal, are no Argument of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and general practice of the Church. And there is no mark of theſe invocations, till <hi>Proceſſions</hi> were frequented with <hi>Litanies,</hi> which conſiſted moſt an end of them: and, could not bee in uſe before the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but were not in uſe till a good while after it. The abuſe hath encreaſed ſo far, (eſpecially in addreſſes to the bleſſed Virgin) that the ſame things are deſired of them, and in the ſame terms, in which they are deſired of God, even in the holy Scripture. That the appearance of Devotion, to the Mother, is viſibly, and outwardly, no leſs then to the Son. So that, were there not a profeſſion of that Church extant, contradicting the proper ſenſe of ſuch prayers, and forcing them that addreſs them, unleſs they will contradict themſelves, to abate their own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to expound them to ſignifie no more, then obtaining that of God which they are deſired to grant of themſelves; they could not bee excuſed of Idolatry. But can by no means be excuſed, for leading ſimple Chriſtians upon a Praecipice of ſuch horrible danger; by encouraging both them, and thoſe that teach them ſuch devotions. For, did not carnal Superſtition hope for temporal bleſſings, from ſuch voluntary applications, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That which hath been ſaid of the Primitive Liturgy, barreth<note place="margin">No Common Prayer in the Pulpit by Gift; but in a ſet form, at the Communion Table.</note> the pretenſe of this time, requiring the Liturgy ſetled by Law of this Kingdom to bee changed, upon a ground never heard of in the Church, for 1600 years. That every Miniſter (whether mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhop; Prieſt and Deacon or Prieſt only) is to have a gift in praying: and that his people ought to pray that which his gift furniſheth, and not that which the Church preſcribeth. And, to the end that ſuch gifts may be uſed; that no Miniſter be tied to celebrate the Euchariſt above thrice a year: and that, in caſe hee have convenient company. But, that they, whoſe age and infirmity enables them not to preach and pray thus in the Pulpit,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48725:63"/> reading the Service over and above, bee not tied to miniſter the Service preſcribed. Now would I have thoſe that demand this to ſhew me, that ever the prayers, for which the Church meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, were made in the Pulpit, for 1500 years after Chriſt. I know I have alleged a prayer of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> before his Sermon; I know there is a paſſage of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alleged to the ſame purpoſe. But neither of them ſignifies any more, then a prayer to God, to bleſs them in their preaching. The Common Prayers of the Church are another thing; even that which I have ſaid. The common prayers of the Church, on all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ſolemn Aſſemblies, were made at the Altar; becauſe the Euchariſt was held always, and ought to bee held always, the principal Office of Gods ſervice, for which Chriſtians ought to aſſemble, more frequently, then there can bee either ability, or opportunity for preaching. And that which I have ſaid of the Primitive Liturgy is full evidence hereof. For I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſet form of it; (which theſe men return a <hi>non inventus</hi> of to his Majeſties Commiſſion) but, that ever there was any Prayer of the people uſed in the Pulpit, will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>I grant that there were miraculous Graces under the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Apoſtolical Graces ſubject to Order.</note> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> directs the uſe of, in miniſtring the prayers of the Church. But, that all Miniſters had them, they who require an ordinary Gift, in all Miniſters, to that purpoſe, cannot prove. Much leſs, that this ordinary Gift is to ſucceed thoſe miraculous graces, in all Miniſters. For even then, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Spirits of the Prophets were to bee ſubject to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> becauſe <hi>God is not the God of confuſion, but</hi> of order. And therefore charges all that pretended to ſuch graces, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Grace of an Apoſtle in him: and to bee ſubject to the <hi>Orders</hi> which there hee gives out. If the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of Gods Spirit were ſo diſpenſed, that inferiors could preſume nothing to the prejudice of <hi>Order,</hi> againſt Superiors, upon that pretenſe; Much more, now that Chriſtianity is ſetled, and the Unity of the Church a part of it, are the Gifts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors to bee ruled by the gifts of Superiors; that Order, in which Unity conſiſteth, may bee preſerved.<note place="margin">Of the Graces of the Spirit in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Original of Litanies.</note>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Spirit maketh interceſſion for the Saints with groans unutterable.</hi> And St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith thereupon,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48725:64"/> that they who had theſe <hi>Miraculous Graces,</hi> being imployed to miniſter the prayers of the Church, did offer them to God with thoſe deep ſighs, and groans, which could hardly expreſs what the Spirit ſuggeſted. But addeth, that the Deacon did the ſame in his time. And this is viſibly true, by all that remains of the Liturgy, in the Records of the Church. It is evident, that though the Biſhop or Prieſt, celebrating the Euchariſt, did offer the Common Prayers which I have deſcribed; yet the Deacon alſo indited the ſame to the people, from point to point, as you have it to this day in our Engliſh Litanies; the people anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from point to point; <hi>Lord have mercy;</hi> or ſome ſuch acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as our Litanies do direct. So far is the Catholique Church from the Maxime now pretended; that the Prieſt alone is the mouth of the people in their prayers. And the ſighs and groans of that deep devotion, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith the Spirit then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that the people, anſwering the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, then expreſſed, the form of our Litanies now containeth and expreſſeth. And indeed, thoſe prayers which the Deacon indited, are called Litanies, in divers of the antient Liturgies; Shewing that our Litanies are but a Tranſcript of them, for the uſe of other occaſions, beſides the Celebration of the Euchariſt. And <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> may remember how much they miſtook <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Martyr;</hi> thinking hee had ſaid, that the Miniſter prayed thus <hi>according to his Gift;</hi> Who ſaith indeed, that hee prayed <hi>with all his might;</hi> to wit, with all the Devotion he could uſe. Which devotion, as it is not to bee found in their Pulpit Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, pretending to apply the Gift to the preſent occaſion; ſo it viſibly breathes in the Litanies, through all occaſions of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>When miraculous Graces failed, the prayers of the Church<note place="margin">The Prayers of the Euchariſt how preſcribed by the Apoſtles.</note> were not to fail. And, the Apoſtles having delivered that which I have ſaid to the Church; whoſoever was authorized to celebrate the Euchariſt, both muſt bee, and eaſily might bee inſtructed, how hee ſhould diſcharge that Office. There is ſo much agreement, both for mater, and manner, in that which remains of it, in the Records of the Church, as to juſtifie thoſe, that affirm it to bee received by Tradition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Thus was the Forme preſcribed from the beginning. In time abuſes might come. For what Rule can there bee in

It muſt bee ſaid, that it was not the Reforming, but the <hi>Deforming</hi> of the Church: And the reforming thereof conſiſts in reſtoring the Euchariſt, into the place that it ought to hold among the Offices of the Church; So that the Communion thereof may bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt generally, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continually frequented, by Chriſtians moſt prepared.

The ſubſtance of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein ſalvation conſiſteth, was determined by our Lord in perſon, to his Apoſtles. That which hee truſted them with, was the regulating of his Church, ſuppoſing the ſame Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; that God might bee ſerved by the Aſſemblies of ſuch,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48725:65"/> as might appear to profeſs it. That which he truſted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with, the Church remains, of neceſſity, truſted with by the Apoſtles; ſaving the perſonal Gift of the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles, rendring their Acts blameleſs, in that eſtate for which they were made; though not ſufficient for all eſtates of the Church. Otherwiſe, the power of the whole Church is the power of the Apoſtles: and obligeth the parts of the Church, not to tranſgreſs the Acts of it. Becauſe the Unity of the Church is equally concerned in them; and the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity in neither of both. This diſcovereth the Superſtition of that Impoſture which is pretended, by deriving the Obligation of the Lords Day from the Jewiſh. Sabbath. For what reaſon can endure, that the Church ſhould bee bound to keep the firſt day of the week, by that Precept, which tyed the Synagogue to keep the laſt day of the week? Seeing then, the Obligation of it is to bee derived from the Act of the Apoſtles; (that is, from the power of the Church; For, being once received by the whole Church, it is for ever received to the ſame effect; if the premiſes bee true) it is the ſame Obligation that tyes all, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the times appointed, for the ſervice of God, by the Church; whether Faſting days or Feſtivals. The Example of the Primitive Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> juſtifieth St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others of the Fathers, affirming; that the Church ſhould, and would ſerve God continually, in publick, could the buſineſs of the world ſtand with it. And therefore, that order is to bee accounted moſt Chriſtian, that provides moſt opportunity, for frequenting the publick ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>If this were conſidered, it would appear a meer Impoſture,<note place="margin">Therefore other Feſtivals, and times of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are to bee obſerved.</note> to demand, that the Lords day bee celebrated with Sermons morning and evening, and arbitrary prayers to uſher them in and out; treading underfeet all other times, ſet apart by the whole Church, for the ſervice of God, by ſuch Offices as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth.

               <p>The Caſe is the ſame in the qualities of places, as well as of<note place="margin">How places and perſons become qualified for Gods Service. Preaching not convertible with mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> perſons. For the exerciſe of Chriſtianity by the Law of this Kingdom, there muſt bee places where all muſt meet; they muſt bee limitted by the authority of the Church; they muſt not bee balked, for other places of mens private choiſe, but by thoſe that are willing to bee charged with Schiſme for doing it. They that quarrel the Biſhops power in all other things, muſt call this alſo in queſtion, when they mean to <hi>weigh by their own Weights,</hi> and <hi>mete by their own Meaſures.</hi> They are very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to confound the difference between Prieſts and Deacons, by having all called <hi>Miniſters;</hi> being a Term that may ſerve all Orders, <hi>miniſtring thoſe Offices</hi> which the Church enableth them to miniſter. But they who would impoſe this ſenſe upon the ſtile of <hi>Miniſters of Gods Word and Sacraments;</hi> that all, and no other but they who are ordained to <hi>Preach,</hi> are ordained alſo to <hi>Baptize and celebrate the Euchariſt;</hi> muſt bee told that this is an Impoſture, till they ſhew better reaſon for it, then hitherto hath been ſhewed. For I conceive, I have ſhewed ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the power of celebrating the Euchariſt is convertible with the power of the Keys, qualifying all Chriſtians for the Euchariſt; which, in the Biſhop onely, extendeth to publick cauſes, concerning his whole <hi>Church</hi> or Dioceſe; But in all Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to private Cauſes, wherein it may bee queſtionable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Conſcience, whether a Chriſtian bee quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the Euchariſt, or not. As for the Sacrament of Baptiſme; that, as the Biſhop only allows it, in any caſe that may bee queſtionable; ſo, the miniſtring of it may come to a Deacon, in the Prieſts abſence, nay to a Lay-man, rather then that any Child ſhould dye unbaptized. Neither is the Office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrained, either to Prieſts or Deacons alone, by any other authority, then that of Gods whole Church; Which being once paſſed in the Caſe, by the general Cuſtom and Practice of it, it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48725:66"/> muſt bee the greateſt Sacrilege in the World; that is, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Schiſme; to tranſgreſs it.</p>
               <p>The reſpect due to the memories of the Apoſtles, and other<note place="margin">Times, places, perſons, and things conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Gods Service, under the Goſpel.</note> Saints and Martyrs of Chriſt, is a reaſon ſufficient to determine the time and place for the ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God. To queſtion, that they are not juſt occaſions for the conſecrating of Feſtivals and of Churches, to the ſervice of God, in honour of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; is a juſt preſumption, that men ſeek to bee ſaved by ſome other Chriſtianity, then that which their Doctrine and their Blood planted. But their names, and the Feſtivals and the Churches that bear their names, are but circumſtances, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that ſervice to bee acceptable to God, which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Unity of his Church; the authority whereof aſſigneth them to that purpoſe. No more are the Utenſils and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Churches, the Veſſels in which the Sacraments are ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated. But they who think it Superſtition that theſe things ſhould bee ſet apart from Vulgar uſe, and reſerved only for Gods ſervice, plainly commit Idolatry to their own Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it. For it is manifeſt, that Conſecration was in force, not only by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but before it, under the Law of nature, as the Fathers call it; under thoſe precepts which God gave <hi>Noah</hi> after the Flood, as the Jews will have it. And therefore, it tended, not only to figure Chriſt to come, but to maintain the ſervice of God, and that reverence which it ought to bee performed with. What colour can there bee, that the Conſecrations that were in force by the Law were figurative of Chriſt to come? And the Sacrilege of <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> remain unqueſtionable; becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Church, upon Oblations conſecrated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from the beginning, is as viſible as the Church. As for the ſenſe of the Catholique Church from the beginning, hee that believes the Unity thereof cannot queſtion it. They therefore that have the Impudence to make that Superſtition, which the people of God, both before and ſince Chriſt, have always uſed for the ſervice of God, do they not commit Idolatry to their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; which they prefer ſo far before all the world beſides? Indeed the ſolemnity of Conſecration requires a further queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of Ceremonies in the ſervice of God; whether or no they be for the advantage of Gods ſervice: whether or no it bee in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48725:67"/> the power of the Church, to determine them for that purpoſe. For the ſolemnity of Conſecrations paſſes not without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>Wee have this character of the Presbyterians publiſhed for<note place="margin">Ceremonies fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſying by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Gods ſervice.</note> their advantage; That they allow the <hi>natural expreſſions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and devotion,</hi> as kneeling, and lifting up of the hands and eyes in prayer: as alſo, thoſe meer circumſtances of <hi>decency and order,</hi> the omiſſion whereof would make the ſervice of God, either not decent, or leſs decent; but Ceremonies of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted myſtical</hi> ſignification they allow not. But are not the myſteries of Chriſtianity, the Incarnation, Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, things inſtituted by God, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by nature? Is not the ſignifying of them, whereby they come to Remembrance, the means to procure and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that Reverence and Devotion, which wee are to attend the ſervice of God with, and the inward affection which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth? And why not then Ceremonies, inſtituted to ſignifie things, which Gods Grace, not nature determineth? Shall it be Chriſtianity to believe the Inſtitution of things above nature, for our ſalvation by Gods Grace; and ſhall it bee prejudicial to Chriſtianity, to inſtitute the means of procuring that Reverence and Devotion, which the Remembrance of them, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice of God requireth? ſhall the worſhip of God by Chriſtians be tyed to ſignifie no more, then nature directeth Jews, Mahometans, and Pagans to ſignifie by it? Compare this new Goſpel with the perpetual practice of Gods people, whether before or after the Law, whether before or after Chriſt; And you ſhall eaſily ſee, that it cannot bee accounted Superſtition, but by thoſe that commit Idolatry to their own Imaginations.</p>
               <p>Let the ſignification bee that which natural reaſon is able to<note place="margin">What kind of ſignification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</note> interpret, in all ſorts of Chriſtians; and, whether they allow it to bee called <hi>Myſtical</hi> or not, they muſt allow it, as properly <hi>Religious;</hi> that is, as tending to advance that Devotion, which the Religion of a Chriſtian ſignifieth, in the point of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And truely I do not, nor doth this Church, to my knowledg, allow the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48725:67"/> ſignifications. They that ſerve God in a Language unknown to the people, do accordingly, when they ſerve him with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which they cannot underſtand. Allowing it Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to ſerve God in Engliſh, I allow it Reformation, to cut off the Superfluity of ſuch Ceremonies; as ſtealing the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Devotion from the heart, wherein God hath placed his ſervice. And therefore, I think it reaſon to ſubmit to this Iſſue; whether or no, the Ceremonies in queſtion bee accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſe of the Primitive Church; which the Reformation pretendeth, or ſhould pretend, to reſtore. For I find, that, in the Primitive and Good Times of Chriſtianity, the Church was far enough from ſeeking ſuch abſtruſe and far fetched ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. And that is a viſible Rule, which the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Reformation determines. But I allow no man to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the uſe of the Primitive Church, grown out of uſe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, in bar to any Ceremony now ſetled by Law; not <hi>weighing by the ſame Weights,</hi> nor <hi>meting by the ſame Meaſures,</hi> in all other things. It is neither good conſcience in them, nor would bee in the Publick, to change a Law of the Land upon a pretenſe, which they that allege will not ſtand to, in another Caſe.</p>
               <p>But is it enough for Presbyterians to <hi>allow</hi> Ceremonies which<note place="margin">Not enough for the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to allow Ceremonies.</note> nature teacheth, to allow order and decency in circumſtances? Have they debauched this wretched people to ſuch horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, and irreverence, that they can think fit to pray ſitting on their ſeats; to ſuch barbarous confuſion, that they can think every mans own fanſie the beſt order, to exerciſe the Liberty of Chriſtians in Gods ſervice; and now think to ſatisfie with <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> the contrary? What ſhall the Church gain by reconciling them, if, having contributed ſo much to the deſtruction of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they contribute not more then ſo to the reſtoring of it? but that muſt bee the care of Superiors. I will only mention the ſign of the Croſs; a Ceremony of ſo much reverence, and ſo general uſe in the whole Church of God, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that nothing but the difficulty of recalling it, preſerving Unity among our ſelves, can excuſe this Church for not reſtoring it in many other Offices. But, to put it out of the Office of Baptiſme would bee to condemn the Whole Church of God, without giving ſatisfaction to them, who, having obtained the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48725:68"/> ſilencing of it in Conſecrating the Euchariſt, according to the Liturgy, under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. have thereby been encouraged to demand ſo much more.</p>

For, hee hath not this hope to God, hee appeareth not to the Church to have it, but upon theſe terms. And thus far the parties ſeem content. But why ſhould not Presbyters <hi>Confirm,</hi> as well as Biſhops; that can baptize and celebrate the Euchariſt, which is more to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſtians? By Commiſſion from Biſhops, that they may do it, is a point very diſputable. The practiſe of the Greek Church, in the caſe, is not new; Beſides ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the like under S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the Weſt. But that ſerves not the turn. They muſt have the <hi>Catechiſing</hi> of them after their mode; and make the grounds of Salvation what they pleaſe, and not what the Church appointeth. So the Anſwer is eaſie. For neither is Baptiſm or the Euchariſt miniſtred, but by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Biſhop; And to Catechize, beſide that Form which the Church allowes, is to ſow the ſeed of everlaſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, in matter of Faith.

For hee cannot mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the means of Salvation alone. But the Faith, and the Unity of his Church with the reſt, is not to bee preſerved without him. Therefore the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which Baptiſm promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, dependeth upon the Biſhops bleſſing; becauſe it depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Unity of the Church. Therefore Haereticks and Schiſmaticks; who, by departing from the Unity of the Church, barre themſelves of the effect of their Baptiſm; being received with the Biſhops bleſſing, in the Primitive Church, were juſtly thought to recover their Title to it.</p>

They could not receive the Power of the Keyes, from them that had nothing to do to give it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in celebrating the Euchariſt, they do nothing but profane Gods Ordinance. Therefore, the lawful Ordaining of them is not re-ordaining; but Ordination indeed, inſtead of that which was only ſo called.</p>

If his ſin bee notorious, ſo much the more; Becauſe hee muſt then ſatisfie the Church, that hee doth what is requiſite to ſatisfie God; that is, to appeaſe his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48725:69"/> wrath, and to recover his Grace. The Church may bee many ways hindred, to take account of notorious ſin.

For, the Feaſt was, from the beginning, the end of the Faſt. So, the <hi>Lent</hi>-Faſt, and the keeping of the Lords day, ſtand both upon the ſame authority. For, the Lords day is but the Remembrance of the Reſurrection once a week. It doth not appear that the Faſt was kept forty days, from the beginning. That it was kept before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whenſoever <hi>Eaſter</hi> was kept; that is, from the time of the Apoſtles; it doth appear. The baptizing of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> the reſtoring of the <hi>Relapſed,</hi> and the preparing of all, by extraordinary Devotion, to ſolemnize the Reſurrection; was the work of it. Did this Church deſire the reſtoring of this Order, and yet diſowne <hi>Lent? Daniel</hi> abſtained from <hi>pleaſant meat</hi> when hee faſted; The Jewes forbad all that comes of the Vine, on the day of Attonement; The Whole Church of God always forbore Fleſh and Wine when they faſted. And ſhall our Licentiouſneſs make the difference of meats ſuperſtitious? Then let the late Parliament Faſts bee Reformation, that provided a good break-faſt to faſt with, and heard a Sermon as well after Dinner as before.</p>

But, whether all ſinners can bee brought to know what that is; or knowing, to impoſe it upon themſelves; let the common reaſon of Chriſtians judge. They that aſſure them of pardon, and the favour of God without it; whether it bee themſelves, or their falſe teachers; plainly they murther their ſouls. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in making the Keys of the Church, the neceſſary means for pardon of all ſin that voids the Grace of Baptiſme, goes beyond the bounds of truth: In procuring a Law, that all ſubmit to it once a year, goes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of Juſtice. It were to bee wiſhed, that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48725:70"/> abuſes of that Law might be cured, without taking it away. For, if it bee the power of the Keys that makes the Church the Church; It will bee hard to ſhew the face of a Church, where the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Church, and the Communion of the Euchariſt is granted, and yet no power of the Keys at all exerciſed? Nay, it will appear a lamentable caſe, to conſider, how ſimple innocent Chriſtians are led on till death, in an opinion, that they want nothing requiſite for the obtaining and aſſuring of the pardon of their ſins; when it is as manifeſt, that they want the Keys of the Church, as it is manifeſt, that the Keys of the Church are not in uſe for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>James</hi> ordaineth, that the Presbyters of every Church<note place="margin">Of anointing the ſick, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to S. <hi>James.</hi>

This ſuppoſeth them qualified, by ſubmitting their ſins to the Keys of the Church, which the Presbyters do manage. The promiſe belongs not to the Office of Presbyters upon other terms. Hee requireth them alſo <hi>to anoint the ſick with oyl;</hi> promiſing Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon it. Not to all that ſhould bee anointed. For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then ſhould not dye, if true Chriſtians. But, as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Lord had uſed it; to evidence their Commiſſion to the World: So was the <hi>manifeſtation of Gods Spirit,</hi> reſiding in the Church, granted for the benefit of his Church. Neither is there any cauſe, why the ſame benefit ſhould not bee expected; but the decay of Chriſtianity in the Church. In the mean time, the forgiveneſs of ſin, according to St. <hi>James,</hi> comes by the Keys of the Church; Recovery of health, from the prayers of it. So, the Unction of the ſick is to recover health, not to prepare for death; as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now uſeth it. But, ſuppoſing the health of the ſoul reſtored by the Keys of the Church.</p>

Our Presbyterians, in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> duely prohibit Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in thoſe degrees of alliance, which are prohibited in blood. But out of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> if they will prove it, their word muſt ſerve for our warrant, that this is the ſenſe. If Man and Wife

But man and wife are not one fleſh by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; licenſing plurality of wives, and divorce; though by the Law of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. It was diſpenſed with after the Flood, and not revived but by our Lord. That Divorce, and plurality of wives, was not reſtrained, but by the Goſpel; it is impudence to Diſpute, much more to deny. The Mariage of the Niece, with the Uncle of the half blood, hath puzzled all them that would make it unlawful by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. The Mariage of a Chriſtian with two Siſters ſucceſſive, will bee as hard to condemn by the ſame. Granting the premiſes, all theſe Diſputes ceaſe. Mariage is the Bond of one with one, not to bee diſſolved till death; by the Law of Chriſt, not by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whether Adultery diſſolve the Bond or not, I leave it diſputable for the preſent, as I find it. Mariage with a Pagan was void by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. St. <hi>Paul</hi> enables Chriſtians to hold to it. Therefore hee refers them not to the Law. Chriſtianity improves <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in all things. Therefore Chriſtians cannot be regulated by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, in Matrimonial cauſes. Therefore, in the prohibiting of degrees, as well as of divorce. For <hi>Moſes</hi> Law prohibits more then that Law, which the Children of <hi>Noah</hi> received after Flood, had done. It were better to reſtrain all that which the preſent Canon Law reſtrains; then that the inceſts of the late licentious times ſhould bee tolerated. For, the preſent Canon Law reſtrains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not much more, then the Greek Church reſtrains. But, if the Authority thereof bee not binding, by reaſon of the Uſurpations of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet, to depart from the Canons of the Whole Church, and of thoſe times which wee acknowledg, would bee a departure from the whole Church.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48725:71"/> Chriſtians profeſſed to Chriſtians, when they were to receive the Communion with them. At this rate, it is no marvel that there are found ſeven Sacraments in the Fathers; For there are more then ſeven to bee found, if there bee as many Sacraments, as Ceremonies inſtituted by the Church.</p>

                  <p>The worſhip of the Hoſt, in the Papacy, is not Idolatry. Chriſtianity would ſanctifie kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Euchariſt, though it were. What Images the ſecond Commandment forbiddeth. Reverencing of Images in Churches is not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Of honouring Images, and of having them in Churches. Mutual forbearance, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyneth the Romans, not enjoyned elſewhere. Tender Conſciences are to ſubmit to Superiors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THey who give the honour proper to God to his creature are<note place="margin">The worſhip of the Hoſt, in the Papacy, is not Idolatry.</note> Idolaters. They that worſhip the Hoſt give the honour due to God to his creature. This is taken for a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the worſhip of the Hoſt is Idolatry. But will any Papiſt acknowledg that hee honours the Elements of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, or as hee thinks, the Accidents of them, for God? Will common reaſon charge him to honour that, which hee believeth not to bee there? A Pagan, that honours the Sun for God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves him to bee God. And therefore another Pagan may as well believe another creature to bee God. Both Idolaters, for thinking the Godhead to bee in one or more creatures. But thoſe greater Idolaters, who thought that the Godhead; to which, they took men, (whether living or dead) or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to bee advanced; was incloſed in their Images conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the worſhip of them. Hee that worſhips the Hoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves our Lord Chriſt to bee the only true God, hypoſtatically united to our fleſh and blood. Which being preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, in ſuch a manner, as it is not preſent every where;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48725:72"/> there is due occaſion to give it that Worſhip in the Euchariſt, which the Godhead, in our manhood, is to bee worſhipped with, upon all due occaſions. Thus, wee ſay, hee was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in the Antient Church, that believed the Elements to bee preſent. And they were no Idolaters. They that worſhip the Hoſt do not believe that they remain. Nay, they ſay, they muſt bee flat Idolaters, if they bee there. Zeal to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion makes them ſay more then they ſhould ſay. But, if they were there, they would not take them for God; and therefore they would not honour them for God: And that is it, (not ſaying that they ſhould bee Idolaters if the Elements did remain) that muſt make them Idolaters.</p>

Were worſhipping the Hoſt Idolatry; Chriſtianity, uſing the geſture of kneeling, to ſignifie the worſhip of Chriſt, were enough to ſanctifie it to Gods ſervice. And this they muſt grant who ſerve God in Churches, which the Maſs hath been uſed in; taking the Maſs for Idolatry, as they do. In fine, Jews and Mahumetans are bound to take the Worſhip o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Hoſt for Idolatry. For they will needs take the worſhip of the Holy Trinity for no leſs. But they who know, that the Godhead of Chriſt is the reaſon, for which his fleſh and blood is worſhipped in the Euchariſt, cannot take that Worſhip for Idolatry, becauſe his fleſh and blood is not preſent in the Euchariſt as they who worſhip it there think it is. For they know, that the fleſh and blood of Chriſt is no <hi>Idol</hi> to Chriſtians, whereſoever it is worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Whether or no, having Images in Churches bee a breach of<note place="margin">What Images the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.</note> the ſecond Commandment; can bee no more queſtion, then, whether or no, to have any Images bee a breach of it. For it muſt forbid Images in Churches, becauſe it forbids all Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it bee interpreted to forbid onely <hi>Idols;</hi> that is, Images of falſe Gods; it muſt bee proved, that all Images in Churches are <hi>Idols,</hi> before it bee proved, that they are forbidden by it. It is far more reaſonable to ſay; that the Cherubims, the Brazen
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48725:72"/> Serpent, the Bulls, and other Images in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, were no breaches of it; Then to ſay, that God did diſpenſe with his own Precept in thoſe caſes; having no appearance of any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in the Scripture, in which the Precept, and the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breach are both recorded. But it is manifeſt, that the Jews allow ſome kind of Imagery; and I doubt not, but the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans do the like. And it is manifeſt, that the publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that Nation, or Religion, could never diſpenſe in that which Gods Law had prohibited. But it is manifeſt on the contrary, that it did and might reſtrain that, which Gods Law had licenſed; to ſet an hedge about the Law, and keep the people further from breaking it. Now their reſtraints tye not Chriſtians, but Jews. And therefore it is manifeſt, that the Church is tyed no further, then there can appear danger of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; Which if it bee ſo heightned, beyond appearance, as to involve the Church in the crime of it, chargeth the Schiſme that may come by that means, upon thoſe that ſo inhanſe it.</p>
               <p>Now, granting that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the Council of <hi>Elvira</hi> did hold all Images in Churches dangerous for Idolatry; (of<note place="margin">Reverencing of Images in Churches is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idolatry.</note> which there is appearance) it is manifeſt, that they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards admitted all over. And there might bee jealouſie of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, in having Images in Churches, before Idolatry was quite rooted out; of which afterwards, there might bee no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But no manner of appearance, that Images in Hiſtory ſhould occaſion Idolatry to thoſe Images, in them that hold them the Images of Gods creatures; ſuch as are thoſe Images, which repreſent Hiſtories of the Saints, out of the Scriptures, or other relations of unqueſtionable credit. The ſecond Council of <hi>Nicaea</hi> ſeems to have brought in, or authorized addreſſes to ſolitary Images of Saints, placed upon Pillars to that purpoſe; whereof there is much mention in the Records of it. But, to the Images of Saints, there can bee no Idolatry, ſo long as men take them for Saints; that is, Gods creatures. Much leſs to the Images of our Lord. For it is the honour of our Lord, and not of his Image. Whereas they who thought their falſe Gods to dwell in their Images, (which thought made them Idols) muſt needs honour them with the honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God; though, in ſo doing, they honoured indeed the Devil, that brought in Idols. Nay the Council it ſelf, though
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48725:73"/> it acknowledg, that the Image it ſelf is honoured, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given to that which it ſignifieth, before the Image; yet it diſtinguiſheth this honour from the honour of our Lord. And therefore teacheth not Idolatry, by teaching to honour Images; though it acknowledg, that the Image it ſelf is honoured, when it need not.</p>
               <p>For indeed, and in truth, it is not the <hi>Image,</hi> but the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of honouring Images, and of having them in Churches.</note> that is honoured, by the honour that is ſaid to be done to the Image, becauſe it is done before the Image. The Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Utenſils of the Church were honoured, in the Spotleſs times of the Church, as conſecrated to Gods ſervice; though the honour of them, being uncapable of honour for themſelves, was manifeſtly, and without any ſcruple, the honour of God. But Images, ſo long as they were uſed to no further intent, then the Ornament of Churches, the remembrance of holy Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the raiſing of devotion thereby; (as, at the firſt, they were uſed by the Church) came in the number of things conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Gods ſervice. And that Council was never of force in the Weſt, till the uſurped power of the Pope brought it in by force. Nor did the Weſtern Church, when it refuſed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, diſcharge the having of Images in Churches, upon thoſe reaſons, and to thoſe purpoſes which I have declared. So far they remain ſtill juſtifiable. For, hee that ſees the Whole Church on the one ſide, and only <hi>Calvin</hi> on the other ſide, hath hee not cauſe to fear, that they who make them Idolaters without cauſe, will themſelves appear Schiſmaticks in the ſight of God for it? For, what are they elſe, who pleaſe themſelves in a ſtrange kind of <hi>negative ſuperſtition,</hi> that they cannot ſerve God, if they ſerve him with viſible ſignes of reverence? who hate the Images, becauſe they hate the Saints themſelves, and their Chriſtianity? And therefore, that it bee not thought, that we are tyed to thoſe terms of diſtance, which ignorant Preachers drive their Factions with; It is neceſſary to declare the grounds of truth, though it diſpleaſe.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the Romans, that were partly Jews,<note place="margin">Mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> partly Gentiles, converted to Chriſtianity, (as appears by the whole Epiſtle) forbids them to condemn or deſpiſe one another, for making conſcience of things (<hi>meats, and times</hi> hee expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th) forbidden by the Law; or for uſing them without differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48725:73"/> Hence it is now argued; that nothing can bee impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Chriſtian, which, out of tenderneſs of conſcience, hee may think it againſt Gods Law for him to do. The Anſwer is, by denying the conſequence. And the reaſon, becauſe it is a particular order of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to that Church, for the preſent eſtate of it at that time; And therefore it doth not follow, that the Church can make no Law. For it could make no Law, if it were enough to diſcharge any man; that it is againſt his conſcience to obey. The evidence for this reaſon is this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appears, that the Apoſtles did order otherwiſe in the ſame cauſe, when the caſe was not the ſame. For it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had made an Act in Council, commanding the Gentiles that were converted to Chriſtianity, to abſtain from Fornication, and things offered in ſacrifice to Idols, from things ſtrangled and from blood; In fine, from thoſe things, from which, ſtrangers, that were licenſed by the Law to live in the Land of promiſe, were hound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain. And might not thoſe converted Gentiles have ſcrupled, whether or no it were lawful for them, to bee ſo far Jews; had not the authority of the Apoſtles been ſufficient to put an end to their ſcruples? But it is manifeſt likewiſe, that, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> differed with St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> about the neceſſity of compliance with the Jews, for Gentiles turned Chriſtians, hee did forbid, and muſt needs forbid his followers to ſhew this compliance; leſt by that means, hee might hold them in an opinion of the neceſſity of the Law, for the ſalvation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Here were contrary Proviſions, with force of Law, in that very caſe, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands only mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance at <hi>Rome,</hi> in that eſtate wherein he writ his Epiſtle.

This capacity was reſtrained, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, by her Injunctions; by the Articles of Religion; by an Act of Parliament; not to ſigniſie the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, or the diſclaiming of Eccleſiaſtical power, in part or in whole. And to ſuch effect, that it is acknowledged now, in books written on purpoſe, by one party of Recuſants, that they may freely take the Oath of Supremacy; ſaving the ſcruple
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48725:75"/> that may remain, of offending thoſe Recuſants, who think that they may not take it. And I can by no means marvel at it. For, they who do openly profeſs that unlimited obedience to the Pope, in Eccleſiaſtical maters, which hee requireth; how can they, ſwearing the Oath of Supremacy, bee thought to abj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e his Eccleſiaſtical power in <hi>England;</hi> the words of the Oath being reſtrained by Law, to diſclaim only the Temporal effect of it?</p>
               <p>But it is manifeſt, that not only the unlimited power of the Pope,<note place="margin">What further ambiguity that Oath involveth.</note> but all authority of a General Council of the Weſtern Churches, (whereof the Pope is and ought to bee the chief member, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the premiſes) may juſtly ſeem to bee diſclaimed, by other words of the ſame Oath. And that; Whereas the Pope uſurped not only upon the Crown, but upon the Clergy of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; all thoſe Uſurpations are, by the Act of Reſumption un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that, when the Oath declares, to maintain all Rights and Pre-eminences an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Crown; you may underſtand that maintenance, which a Subject owes his Sovereign, againſt thoſe that pretend to force his claims from him. But you may alſo underſtand that maintenance, which a Divine owes the Truth, in aſſerting the Title of the Crown, to all rights veſted in it.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48725:75"/> not poſſible, that all they, who are called to this Oath by Law, can ever bee able to diſtinguiſh that ſenſe, wherein they ought, from that wherein they ought not to take it. And therefore, of neceſſity, the Law gives great offenſe; and that offenſe is the ſin of the Kingdom, and calls for Gods vengeance upon it.

               <p>Now it is manifeſt, that all Recuſants believe not the Popes<note place="margin">That this Oat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, how ſhould they bee taken for the enemies of their Country otherwiſe? On the contrary, I have ſhewed, by the Troubles of <hi>Franckford,</hi> in the beginning of the Reformation, that there was then the ſame difference of opinion, amongſt them that held with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, about obedience to Sovereigns, obeying the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And, that the ſame difference of opinion was the cauſe of the late Troubles, appeareth by the aſperſion of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon his late Majeſty, alleged to juſtifie the War againſt him. Whereby it appeareth, that they of that opinion do undergo the Oathes of Supremacy, and Allegiance, as provided only againſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the claims of it; Thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enabled, notwithſtanding the ſame, to limit their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, to that which their Religion ſhall allow. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great Reaſon, why the Kingdom ſhould enact a new Oath, extending the Original Allegiance of all Subjects to all caſes, in which, experience hath ſhewed, or reaſon may foreſee, that Religion may bee pretended, to abridge the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Allegiance. This I am encouraged here to declare, by the late Act of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> eſtabliſhing for the future the form of an Oath, whereby the obligation of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> extended to the renouncing, not only of any claim for the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> but of all pretenſes whatſoever, (whether upon the account of Religion, or of civil Right) of abridging the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of it. For, though I neither maintain nor find fault with the terms which it uſeth; yet, the agreement and the difference between the caſe of both Kingdoms, as it evidenceth to all the neceſſity, ſo it determineth to them that are to underſtand the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48725:76"/> State of both, the agreement and the difference of that which ought to bee provided. And ſeeing it is the true conſequence of the common Chriſtianity, that enables the Kingdom to do this; becauſe ſuppoſing, as it doth, the State of this World, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend to the altering of it; there is great reaſon, why a Divine ſhould bee allowed to ſay it, not entring upon other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, wherein Religion is not concerned. For, in the next place to the bringing in of a new Proviſion, the conſcience of the Kingdom is beſt diſcharged, the Scandals that may bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned removed, the wrath of God prevented or appeaſed, by the ſecular Powers allowing theſe interpretations to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, that may enable all eſtates to depoſe it with <hi>judgement,</hi> as well as with <hi>truth and righteouſneſs.</hi> Wee have this evidence for that which I ſay; that the authorities of thoſe Divines of this Church, that have declared the ſenſe of the Oath of Supremacy with publick allowance, are now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by the Papiſts themſelves, to infer, that the mater of it is lawful, as capable of the ſenſe which they declare.</p>
               <p>Now, the bounds of Reformation being viſible, by the Faith<note place="margin">The extent of Secular Power in Reforming the Church.</note> and the Laws of the Catholique Church; the extent of Secular power in Eccleſiaſtical maters, and over Eccleſiaſtical perſons; (and therefore, in the reforming of them) preſerving Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical power in perſons that have it, by the founding of the Church, from God; cannot remain inviſible. For, in the firſt place, there can bee no queſtion; That the Sovereign as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, is to maintain his own Rights, by ſuch means as hee finds meet, againſt all Uſurpations, under pretenſe of the Church, and the authority of it. For, the common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity aſſureth him, that all ſuch Uſurpations are contrary to it. And beſides, as a Chriſtian Sovereign, it is his Inheritance to bee a Member of the Church, and a Protector of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the ſame right. Therefore all Chriſtian Sovereigns are born Advocates and Patrons of the Faith, and of the Rights of the Whole Church. And if, by lapſe of time, they bee gone to decay; if by any expreſs Act they have been infringed; it lyes in them, to reſtore their Subjects, and themſelves, to thoſe Rights; being brought into evidence by the authority and cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the whole Church. But, ſeeing the determining of the mater of Eccleſiaſtical Law, as well as of Controverſies of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48725:76"/> Faith, belongs to thoſe that have authority in the Church, by the foundation of it; Of neceſſity, the fitting of the preſent Laws of every Church, to thoſe which the whole Church hath been ruled by from the beginning; as the difference, which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the State of thoſe bodies to which they were given, ſhall require; will, by vertue of Gods Law, belong to thoſe that have ſuch authority, by the Foundation of the Church. And upon theſe terms, the right of Secular power in Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is <hi>accumulative,</hi> and not <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the Rights of the Church.

                  </gap>or an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of pernicious conſequence, in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For it ſubmits all the parts of Chriſtianity, to the paſſion and intereſt of perſons, that ſhall bee for the preſent, in power to ſway thoſe maters, wherein the whole Church is concerned. It is a thing manifeſt in the world, that, though that which concerns all, in point of Religion, is to bee treated by all; yet, that which is treated by all, is concluded always, by the authority of a few. So things paſſed, when Councils were frequented. The Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Councils being interrupted; and the preſent Church accepted for Infallible; the See of <hi>Rome</hi> will of neceſſity bee the preſent Church: And the paſſions and intereſts thereof will have as much power, in maters of Religion, as thoſe paſſions and intereſts can allow, and ſtand with. What the effect thereof may bee, I need not argue to thoſe that profeſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, upon that account. Only thus far they may ſeem excuſable, that there is no Act, with force of Law, tying all of that profeſſion to maintain it. Infallibility may bee claimed for the whole Church; And that is true. And it may bee claimed for the preſent Church, which is falſe. They that pretend to reduce us to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would ſpoil their own market, if they ſhould diſtinguiſh thus. Therefore they plead Infallibility, without diſtinguiſhing.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, there is as much difference, between the<note place="margin">So doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in the Scripture.</note> ſufficiency of the Scripture, for the ſalvation of all, and the clear evidence of all that is neceſſary to bee known, for the ſalvation of all, to all, in the Scriptures. The one is as true, and the other as falſe, as the Infallibility of the preſent Church is falſe, and the Infallibility of the whole Church is true. And, to appeal to the Scriptures alone, when the ſenſe of them only is queſtionable, is to declare, that wee will ſubmit to no other trial but our own ſenſe: As they, who declare the preſent Church infallible, can never depart from any thing which once it hath declared.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48725:78"/>
               <p>For it is manifeſt, that they who appeal to the Scriptures<note place="margin">The Trial muſt ſuppoſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> alone, having before this appeal declared themſelves in the points of difference between the Reformation and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> do declare themſelves tyed in conſcience, to ſtand to that ſenſe of the Scripture, upon which they ground their opinion, in the maters of difference. What means then can remain, to bring that to a Trial, which cauſes diviſion upon theſe terms, but to acknowledge one Catholick Church, which our Creed profeſſeth? And by conſequence, to ſubmit our <hi>ſenſe of all Scripture,</hi> that remains in queſtion, all <hi>difference in Doctrine,</hi> all <hi>Laws of the Church,</hi> to bee determined according to the ſenſe and practice of the whole Church; that is, within the bounds of it? For, to proceed to divide the Church ſtill into more and more parties, and Communions; till wee have loſt the ſenſe of any obligation, to hold communion with the whole Church; is more deſtructive to the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, then all that corruption, which the Reformation pretendeth to cure. But, to confining our ſenſe of the Scripture, our opinions in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine, and the Laws which wee demand, within that which the Faith and the Laws of the whole Church may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to require; wee are half the way onward to the point of Reformation, having the ground and the reaſon, and therefore the meaſure and the terms of it.</p>

As for the merit of Grace, by the works which a natural man is able to do; commonly called <hi>meritum congrui,</hi> as that which is fit for God to give, though not for the worth of the works; It is indeed an Errour of greater danger; but never was general in the School, and now generally diſallowed; ſo far it was always from being enjoyned by the Church. But what is this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that furious Doctrine, that the aſſurance of a mans Predeſtination is juſtifying Faith? In which, the opinion of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48725:78"/> Predeſtination to Glory, and of Gods predetermining a man to do all that hee doth, is twiſted together with an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme; that wee are juſtified, and made the children of God, by being aſſured hereof by his Spirit; Not ſuppoſing any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſtianity, in conſideration of which it is had; and by the knowledg whereof it is aſſured us. For they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Gods predetermination is the reaſon and the ground of freedom in mans Will, and of contingence in the effects of it, ſuppoſing freedom and contingence, do thereby bar the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their own miſtake.

               <p>Nay, holding his Chriſtianity, and the Scriptures which<note place="margin">The conſequence of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worſe then that of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> teach it, by the ſame dictate of the Spirit, which aſſures his ſalvation upon thoſe terms; why ſhould hee not hold that which Chriſtianity and the Scriptures teach not, with the ſame devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſſurance, which he accepteth the Scriptures and his Chriſtianity with? Why ſhould hee not, with the Gnoſtickes, and Mahomet, and the Mannichees, place his ſalvation in that which the Spirit teacheth him beſide and above the Scriptures; allowing Chriſtianity for proficients? The ſame conſequence takes hold, in ſome meaſure, of thoſe who believe the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the preſent Church.

Indeed there is not ſo much danger for them. For, the perſons on whom they repoſe themſelves, for the Church, being perſons of that intereſt in the World, which cannot ſtand, with the open corrupting of Chriſtianity; The fear is, that they may authorize thoſe corruptions, which the coming of the World into the Church ſhall make popular; Not, that they ſhall think it for their intereſt, to change that, which it is not popular to change.</p>

And, if they go farther, to think, that, by being aſſured of Gods Grace, they can never dye cut of that eſtate; they may indeed think themſelves tyed to return to God by Repentance; But, may they not eaſily bee deluded to neglect it, thinking themſelves certain before hand that they ſhall do it?

As for the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; that which concerneth Salvation in it is manifeſt, admitting the Premiſes. Namely, that they who make good, or revive the Covenant of their Baptiſm, in receiving it, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the body and blood of Chriſt; and by conſequence his Spirit, hypoſtatically united to the ſame; to enable them to perform it. To which purpoſe, it muſt needs bee requiſite, that this tender bee attributed, not to the Faith of him that receives; (though the tender muſt needs become fruſtrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) but to the Faith of the Church, and the act of that Faith, in executing the order of our Lord, and deputing the Elements to bee the body and blood of Chriſt by Conſecration, before the receiving of them.

Confirmation was, for many hundred years, given after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, before receiving the Euchariſt; which was to bee received by thoſe that were baptized, upon their Baptiſm. If the Biſhop himſelf baptized them, (as uſually hee did baptize thoſe that were baptized in the Mother-Church, at the uſual times of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide</hi>) then did hee Confirm them immediately. If they were baptized in their Pariſhes; which fetched Chriſme from the Mother-Church, on <hi>Maundy Thurſday,</hi> in token of the licenſe to baptize, which they had from the Biſhop; they were brought to the Mother-Church to bee Confirmed. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſign of that which I ſaid; That Confirmation is reſerved to the Biſhop, becauſe his authority it is, that muſt allow the baptized to bee of the number of the Church. For, whereas the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, promiſed in Baptiſm, depends, never the leſs, upon the continuing of the Baptized Members of Gods Church: Is it ſtrange, that the Holy Ghoſt, which Baptiſm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, ſhould bee given him again by Confirmation, as a Member of Gods Church; when, hee that believes and lives as a Chriſtian otherwiſe, cannot have the Holy Ghoſt, unleſs hee continue in the Church, over and above?

Whereas, the celebrating of Ordination with the Communion of the Euchariſt ſignifieth plain enough; That the Grace of miniſtring aright the Office which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive depends upon the Chriſtianity, which they profeſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with, by communicating in the Euchariſt; As well as the effect of it, upon the Chriſtianity of thoſe to whom they ſhall miniſter the ſame. As for the miniſtring of the Keyes of the Church in Penance, whether publick, in notorious ſins, or private, for the aſſuring of thoſe which are not notorious, that they have right to the Euchariſt; you ſee it tends ſtill to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in it. And you may as eaſily ſee, how great is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of this Ordinance in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when it is taught; That, ſubmitting to the Keyes of the Church by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion turneth imperfect ſorrow for ſin, (or, as ſome ſay, ſorrow for the guilt of puniſhment, not for the offenſe of God, which they call <hi>attrition</hi>) into <hi>contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48725:81"/> ſhewed, to bee only an appendage of the Miniſtry of the Keyes, in that eſtate, tending to the recovery of bodily health. And therefore called <hi>extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> by abuſe, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the intent of it were to prepare againſt the conflict of Death, with the ſpiritual enemies of the Soul. For, though the Church, ordaining Prayer for bodily health, can by no means forget the health of the Soul, if it mean to remember the Common Chriſtianity; Yet appeareth it, nevertheleſs, what ground and occaſion the Inſtitution of S. <hi>James</hi> pretendeth. And ſo it appeareth, what dependence the Unction of the Sick, holdeth upon the Communion of the Euchariſt. As for the Marriage of Chriſtians, if it bee under a peculiar rule, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Common Chriſtianity; and, that the intereſt of the Church, in allowing of Marriages, is grounded upon the ſame; It is far from any imputation of abuſe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> celebrateth the ſame at the Euchariſt. For ſeeing our Chriſtianity is particularly concerned in the duties of Marriage; How ſhould the Grace of God, enabling to diſcharge the ſaid duties, bee expected, but by reviving the obligation of our Common Chriſtianity; which the receiving of the Euchariſt ſignifieth? I will not undertake to clear the See of <hi>Rome</hi> from all abuſe of Eccleſiaſtical Power, in multiplying the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Marriage, as beyond neceſſity, ſo beyond the Intereſt of Chriſtianity; and in diſpenſing in them again, for favour or for reward; as having been prohibited for no better reaſon then this; That Power appears moſt, in that which there is leaſt reaſon for. On the other ſide, diſpenſing in thoſe degrees, which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> prohibiteth; and therefore Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to bee farther from allowing; It ſeemeth to ſtretch the Power of the Church beyond the bounds of it. And thus it appeareth, firſt, what relation theſe Offices hold with the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and the Communion of it; and then, what is the point of Reformation, in which the voiding of thoſe abuſes ſtandeth.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48725:81"/> their Biſhops, and againſt them; they cannot make Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods Church, by the Confirmation which ſo they may give. So, they bar the gift of Gods Spirit, which Baptiſme promiſeth a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, by barring the Unity of Gods Church. Again, Ordaining all whom they Ordain to one and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſame Office, of <hi>Preaching the Word and Miniſtring the Sacraments;</hi> Firſt, they uſurpe the power of Ordaining, which they never received any authority by their Ordination to exerciſe; And that in deſpite of their Biſhops, as ſeducing the people from the way of ſalvation, which, by their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they pretend to teach. So, receiving no Power of the Keys, by their Uſurpation, they receive no power to celebrate the Euchariſt; but only to commit ſacrilege, by profaning ſo high an Ordinance. And then, they tread under foot the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachy of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, in deſpite of the whole Church; dividing the authority of their Biſhops among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but aboliſhing the Order of Deacons, by confounding the title of Miniſters; common to all three Orders, for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring their ſeveral Offices; with that ſenſe in which the loweſt Order are called <hi>Deacons,</hi> for miniſtring to Biſhops and Prieſts in their Offices. As for the power of the Keys, which is not that which God left his Church, unleſs the effect of it bee the binding and looſing of ſin; It is plain enough, that, under pretenſe of taking away the ſcandal of notorious ſin, they would have power to ſhame and domineer over their neighbours, overtaken with ſin; but without pretenſe of curing their ſin, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon which they are reſtored. Such Diſcipline goes no further then the outward man, and the reſtraining of him from ſin for ſhame of the world. The preſumption of a voluntary change in the inward man, for hope of Gods Grace, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, muſt bee the effect of the Keys of Gods Church. As for this power, in ſin that is not notorious, what do they pretend more then their Preaching? Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee ſuch as ſhows the cure of ſin; let their diligence in Preaching mortification witneſs. And yet, whether every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can learn, or will bee induced, meerly by Preaching, to uſe that mortification which is requiſite; let them that are able judge. But what viſiting of the ſick do they pretend, but to pray by them, or comfort them; without ever entring into the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48725:82"/> ground of their comfort, upon examination of the conſcience? The bleſſing of Mariage they have reſerved to the Church; but upon an ungrounded preſumption, that the Mariage of Chriſtians is to bee ruled by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The inſufficience whereof being diſcerned by the people, when they were looſe from the Law of the Land, hath occaſioned all the inceſts, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the late times. In the mean time, whereas all theſe Offices are either provided to bring Chriſtians to the Euchariſt, or to bee celebrated with the Euchariſt: It is demanded, that godly Miniſters bee not tied to celebrate the Euchariſt above thrice a year. It ſhould rather bee demanded, how they come to bee counted godly Miniſters that demand this.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſay, how the point of Reformation is<note place="margin">The point of Reformation in the mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both.</note> found, through which the line of it is to paſs, in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Confirmation fitteth for the Euchariſt, by the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and by being a Member of Gods Church. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination giveth ſome degree in the Clergy, above the people; and therefore ſuppoſeth the profeſſion of retiring from the world, more then other Chriſtians undertake to do. The Euchariſt conveyeth Gods Spirit, for the performing of this profeſſion, ſincerely and reſolutely made. Both requiring the Unity of the Church, both are to bee miniſtred by that authority, without which, nothing is to bee done in each Church. The reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of notorious ſin is the Biſhops peculiar. The Prieſt hath authority to cure that which is made known to him. But this authority is not arbitrary, in either of both. The rigor of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Diſcipline, by the Canons of the Church, is quite out of force. But in theſe lees and dregs of Chriſtianity, which now wee draw, there is ſome reaſonable ground to preſume upon, that a ſinner is reſolved to live a good Chriſtian for the future. Let that bee limited, and the power of the Keys will have effect, in barring the ſinner from the Communion, till the preſumption bee viſible in him. But to what ſhall the Keys of the Church reconcile him, when the Euchariſt is celebrated but thrice a year? To what purpoſe is the viſiting of the ſick, but that, upon ſuch preſumption, they may have the Euchariſt, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in the great journey which they are going? The duty of Mariage, among Chriſtians, depends wholly upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; that God gives the maried an intereſt in one anothers body,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48725:82"/> which cannot bee diſſolved but by death. Therefore it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with the Euchariſt, that they who mary with the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Chriſtians may bee enabled, by the Spirit of God, which the Sacrament promiſeth, to perform the ſame.</p>

In the firſt place, the multiplying of Maſſes for the quick and for the dead; without any pretenſe, of the concurrence of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the action, much leſs of any Communion. At this rate, it matters not much in what language it is performed; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no mans devotion required, to aſſiſt the Prieſt in it. The like is ſeen in the Vows of Pilgrimages, and in the viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of divers Churches, for the gaining of Indulgences. For, had men nothing elſe in mind then that Service, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God in all places, why ſhould they think themſelves more acceptable to God, for the travel which they undergo, that they may perform it far from home? whereby they forgo that opportunity for it, which they know, without bettering the mind; which, were it as it might bee, would find means to better it ſelf every where.

The ſame is to bee ſaid of an innumerable number of things, that Monaſtical Orders obſerve; nay, of the overvaluing of the eſtate it ſelf of continence, or retirement from the world; Which, being no part of Chriſtianity, but a help, and an opportunity, for that wherein it conſiſteth, ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth outſide Chriſtians, with that which Pagans can do; the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work; without that inward diſpoſition which only Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity formeth. All theſe, and many more obſervations, which they ſet innocent Chriſtians on work about, muſt needs ſpeak them ſuperſtitious; notwithſtanding that there is always in them a pretenſe of ſerving God, according to Chriſtianity. For, the more ſtraw and chaff, the leſs grain; and, where the intention of the mind is ſpent upon the ſhell of Chriſtianity, there can it not have ſtrength to bring the kernel of it to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48725:83"/> The Ceremonies wherewith they overcharge the publick ſervice of the Church are of the ſame nature.

Do they not think they oblige Almighty God, in ſerving him without any other ſign of reverence? It is not poſſible, that they ſhould ſtand upon it to the diſquiet of the Church, if they did not. Did they not take it for the ſervice of God, that the ſame Houſes ſhould bee Common and Holy, Stables and Churches, the ſame Veſſels Chalices and drinking Cups, the ſame Tables Altars and dining Bords, it is not poſſible that they ſhould trouble the Church about it as they do. But it is plain enough, that they ſerve him without reverence or devotion, becauſe they think ſo. To theſe men, all ſet times of faſting, all the eſtate of continence, all obedience to Superiors, all works of Mortification and Penance, ſtand ſuſpected for Superſtitious. They would not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves far enough from the Papiſts, if they ſhould do the good works of Chriſtians. For fear of private Maſſes, the Euchariſt muſt bee celebrated thrice a year. And wee muſt have the <hi>Opus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum</hi> of a Sermon, in exchange for the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> of a Maſs. But this is not reforming of Religion: It is ſtocking up the Vineyard of the Church, inſtead of Pruning it. I need not ſay what is Reformation, and at what point it ſtands. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the extreams makes the mean viſible. The truth is, there will bee, neceſſarily, ſuperſtition in all Religions, ſo long as the Church hath chaff and corn in it. For, they that are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that obligation to God, which they are not willing to diſcharge, will always diſcharge themſelves to God, upon that which they are content to do for his ſervice; but which hee is not content with, becauſe it ſignifieth not the obedience of the inward man, which hee requireth. Not that there muſt needs bee Superſtition in uſing things indifferent of themſelves; much leſs in uſing ſuch, as in reaſon may ſerve to advance attention and devotion in Gods Service. But becauſe, as there may bee Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48725:83"/> in uſing them; So there is Superſtition in thinking, that by forbearing them, a man does God ſervice. But to think Schiſme acceptable to God, rather then uſe them, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt as great ſuperſtition, as any the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed, why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot bee charged<note place="margin">Why the Pope cannot bee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</note> with Idolatry, I may from thence infer that the Pope cannot bee Antichriſt. I do not grant, that either St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi> in the Apocalypſe ſpeaks any thing of Antichriſt. But hee that exalts himſelf <hi>above all that is called God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh there, muſt bee one that ſhould make himſelf God according to the Idolatry of the Pagans. And the fornication which the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the Apocalypſe, makes the Nations drunk with, is, neceſſarily, the ſame Idolatry. Therefore, if the Pope teach no ſuch Idolatry, hee cannot prove Antichriſt either by St. <hi>John,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The Fathers have thought, that both of them propheſie of ſuch a one as ſhall indeed bee a falſe Chriſt, if ever there ſhall bee ſuch a one; Becauſe hee ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a new Religion, as from God, upon all whom hee ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. But St. <hi>Johns</hi> Catholick Epiſtles, where Antichriſt is mentioned, do not ſignifie that any ſuch is to come. And therefore, wee are not tied to their opinion in the interpretation of a Propheſie, which is no mater of Faith.</p>
               <p>But though the Pope bee not Antichriſt, nor the Papiſts Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,<note place="margin">How it is juſt to Reforme without the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> yet I conceive, I have ſhewed ſufficient reaſon, why this Kingdom and Church of <hi>England</hi> might and ought to Reform Religion, without and againſt the conſent of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuppoſing that which ſeems to bee manifeſt by all that hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would never have condeſcended to any ſuch change.

But will render us with

                  <p>The preſent State of the Queſtion concerning our Service. The Reformation pretended, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Such Preaching and Praying as is uſual, a hindrance of ſalvation, rather then the means to it. What Order of Service, the continual Communion will require. What form of Inſtruction this Order will require. Of that which goes before the Preface, in our Communion Service. Of the Prefaces, and the Prayer of Conſecration. Of the Prayer of Oblation, and the place of it. Of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the dead, in particular. Why the Communion Service at the Communion Table, when no Euchariſt. A ſecondary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, according to preſent Law.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I conceive I have, by this time, ſhewed a reaſon for that<note place="margin">The preſent ſtate of the Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Service.</note> which I ſaid in the beginning; that there is ſo much in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between us and the Puritans, (compriſing in that name all the parties, into which it ſtands now divided) as, if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided for them, would give the Papiſts the advantage againſt the Proteſtants. Now, as for the great queſtion amongſt us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48725:84"/> our Service; if it were truly ſtated, it would ſoon be at an end. If it may bee once conſidered, that the queſtion is, indeed and in truth, whether Sermons ſhall drive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion out of the Church or not; whether or no, arbitrary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Pulpit, ſhall chaſe out of the Church, thoſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> commanded to bee made, and the Church by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand hath frequented ever ſince; I conceive, the Diſpute would bee eaſily decided. And that is the thing in queſtion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in effect, how little ſoever it appear. Certainly, if there were never any common Prayers made in the Pulpit; if there were always common Prayers made at the Altar; they who had no common Prayers but at the Euchariſt, had the Euchariſt as oft as they had common Prayers. Not as if the Church did never aſſemble, but when the Euchariſt was celebrated. But becauſe their deſire and endeavour was, to celebrate the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt once every day; and that in the morning, unleſs it were a Faſt; and always at diſmiſſing the Aſſembly, as the principal Office of it. For hence the Euchariſt came, in time, to bee called <hi>the Maſs</hi> (which had formerly been the name of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly it ſelf) from the <hi>diſmiſſing</hi> of it. And, they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to celebrate the Euchariſt every day, were not like to let Lords days and Feſtivals paſs; or think them ſolemnized, as they ſhould bee by Chriſtians, without it.</p>
               <p>Since therefore I claim, that this came by Tradition of the<note place="margin">The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pretended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abominable.</note> Church, from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> order; I will infer no leſs then I have proved; That, to change the Communion every Lords day and Feſtival, together with Morning and Evening Prayer every day in the Church, and that with the Litanies upon Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and Fridays; which the Law of the Land hitherto requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for two Sermons every Sabbath, with arbitrary Prayers afore or after them, would not bee Reformation but Apoſtaſie. For it is manifeſt, that at the Reformation, the Euchariſt was in poſſeſſion in all Churches, though the Communion had been ſurceaſed. Nor was it ever excepted, that the frequenting hereof had in it any colour of abuſe; or abatement to that very Chriſtiani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, which wee receive from our Lord and his Apoſtles. The abuſe was in private Maſſes. It was alſo a juſt complaint, that the people were not taught their duty out of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and, that the inſtructing of them by preaching was
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48725:85"/> neglected, beyond all reaſon and conſcience. But was it ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the reforming of the abuſe in private Maſſes conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two Sermons a Sabbath; (for wee muſt ſpeak like Jews, if wee will not offend tender conſciences) with the Prayers of the people, ſuch as the Miniſter ſhall pleaſe, before or after it; which is the Reformation now pretended? Had it been ſaid that this is Reformation, when abuſes were ſo viſible, that the name of Reformation was popular; it had been eaſily anſwered, that this were to bring the chief Office of Chriſtianity to little or nothing. And therefore, if this bee the form that was called Reformation in ſome places, it muſt bee ſaid, that it was eaſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But for a Chriſtian Kingdom; having, upon deliberation, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an order, whereby the Euchariſt is to bee celebrated all Lords days and Feſtivals; for Reformations ſake, to leave Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of tender conſciences free, not to celebrate it above thrice a year; (and that, having a competent number to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate; which may bee not once in ſeven years) as now is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; I hope it ſhall never bee ſaid in the ſtreets of <hi>Gath,</hi> that it paſt undeteſted.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary for him that is come to the ſtate of ſalvation,<note place="margin">Such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as is uſual, a hindrance of ſalvation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the means to it.</note> as a Chriſtian, to learn how hee is to live as a Chriſtian; and to grow every day in the knowledg of his duty, that hee may diſcharge it.

Certainly, that which their Preachers now do is ſo far from being neceſſary, that it is no fit means to the ſalvation of the generality of Gods people.

But let not a man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think, if hee have any doubt in ſome difficult point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in ſome nice caſe of Conſcience, in the meaning of ſome leading text of Scripture, that hee is to depend upon the Pulpit for reſolution in it; where it is eaſie (as St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> anſwered St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> about the <gap reason="foreign">

And if you hackney out Miniſters to two Sermons a Sabbath; the people muſt not expect that from them in private, which they cannot expect from the Pulpit. But if it bee thought part of the inſtruction due to Gods people, to make the Laws of the Church, and of the State, and the proceedings of publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a ſubject for the Pulpit; In which, as I ſaid, it is not poſſible for particular Chriſtians to bee ſatisfied, by all the Inquiry they can make in private; then, what may come to paſs, I need ſay to no man, that hath ſeen what hath come to paſs amongſt us. I let paſs leſs abuſes of vain-glory, priding it ſelf in the volubility rather then Eloquence of Language, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring more able Curates, not ſo ready ſpeakers, contemptible to their people; and the like. In which regard, it may many times bee queſtioned, whether the gifts of praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which wee hear ſo much of, bee Gifts of Gods Spirit, which ordinarily ſuppoſe Chriſtianity; or of the evil ſpirit, which always put it to flight. For, all that I have ſaid, of the bad effects of Preaching, is to bee underſtood much more of thoſe prayers, whereby evil doctrine is repeated to God, for a bleſſing of his Spirit upon it. For Chriſtian people, being weakly ſuperſtitious; as the generality of all people are; are apt to place the bond of that Religion, wherein they think themſelves tied to God, in that which they ſee and hear alleged to God in ſo reverend poſtures.</p>
               <p>That Form of Service which wee hitherto uſe hath well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved<note place="margin">What Order of Service, the continual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion will require.</note> all that hath been ſaid, in defenſe of it; being aſſaulted by violent hands, even in thoſe parts, in which it ought to bee inviolable. Nevertheleſs, profeſſing, as I do, that the reſtoring
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48725:86"/> of the continual Communion, is ſuch a point of Reformation, that the Church is not to bee at reſt, till it bee brought to effect; I muſt not ſtick to declare what will bee requiſite, to render our Communion Service uſeful to that purpoſe. I have ſaid, that the word <hi>Litu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gy</hi> is proper to ſignifie nothing elſe, but that form of Service, which the Communion is celebrated with. But I have ſhewed alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that thoſe prayers for all ſtates and conditions of men in Chriſts Church, which are contained in our Litanies, are to bee offered up to God, at the celebrating of it. And ſeeing it was at the Reformation, and is at preſent, a Law in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all Chriſtians ſhould bee preſent at Maſs all Sundays and Feſtivals; And that Reformation conſiſts in reſtoring the Communion; It ſeemeth to me that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of Reformation is not made good, till the preſent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bee brought to effect; that the Euchariſt bee celebrated, all Sundays and Feſtivals, in all Churches and Chappels. And ſo, that all Chriſtians may bee tied to bee preſent; that they may bee brought as neer, as the Church ought to bring them, to communicate. Suppoſing this the intent of the Church; How ſhould it bee attained, without two Aſſemblies, every Sunday and Holy-day-morning, in all Churches? For, let never Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batarians hope to make us ſo perfect Jewes, as to bring us to dreſs no meat on Sundays. If they could, a Pariſh can never bee all at Church at once. The order of the Church never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Church, till it demonſtrate a care of all Chriſtian ſouls a like. Between the hours of eight and twelve, there is time enough for two Aſſemblies. For who would wiſh that either of them ſhould laſt above an hour? The Liturgy is an Office conſiſting of Pſalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Leſſons, intermixed with Hymns: and of the Euchariſt; which, the common Prayers for all ſtates, conditions, and neceſſities in the Church, are to bee offered up to God with. Now, though that which wee call the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice bee compleat for the intent of it, yet I muſt needs find it too long for this purpoſe; to allow time, both for the Euchariſt, and for the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtruction of the people; which I do not intend to exclude out of thoſe Aſſemblies, which I confine to an hour. And how eaſie were it, to frame for this purpoſe an Order of Pſalms and Leſſons, according to the order of the whole Church; Which requires, that the Epiſtles bee read after the Old Teſtament,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48725:86"/> and the Goſpels after them: as in our Communion Service, the Goſpel comes next afore the Creed? For, there would bee room for brief Leſſons out of the Law and Hiſtorical Books, out of the Sapiential Books and Prophets: And after, for the Epiſtles and Goſpels, (which not onely wee, but the Lutherans, as well as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do now uſe) with Hymns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each, according to the Canon of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> received by the Whole Church.</p>
               <p>This is the place for the inſtruction of the people, according<note place="margin">What form of Inſtruction this Order will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</note> to the order of the whole Church. And truly the greater and more ſolemn Aſſemblies may bee capable of edifying, by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eloquent Sermons, which the generality of Pariſh Churches (the edification whereof the Church i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to ſtudy) are very little the better for. And the endleſs number of ſtrifes, that ariſe about the Scripture, and variety of judgments, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and intereſts, in what is fit to bee preached, make the deſign of Homilies neceſſary; rather to reſtrain the abilities of Indiſcreet Preachers, then to help the inabilities of unlearned Preachers. Only that they bee ſo framed, as to contain a courſe of familiar inſtruction, in the whole body of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; not concerning Faith alone, but all the chief duties of Chriſtians; which theſe that wee have do not ſatisfie, though not unfit for the time when they were ſet forth. And being ſo framed; Though it bee all one to the edification of the Church, whether the mater of them bee delivered by word of mouth, as every Miniſter can beſt inſinuate it into the minds of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; or as it may bee couched, word for word, in writing; yet will it bee abſolutely neceſſary, for the inſtruction of all, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Unity of the Whole, that the Ordinary have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not only negatively, that nothing bee taught the people contrary to the form; But poſitively, that the whole mater of it bee taught the people, in ſuch time as the Law ſhall determine; to bee repeated again and again, for the certain proficience of all. For it muſt not avail to ſay; that the people will not come to Church, unleſs they may bee entertained there with variety. Unleſs the people bee content to bee conducted by that which is beſt to ſave their ſouls, though it pleaſe not their fanſies, it ſhall bee but a Church in name, that ſhall bee Ruled by the fanſies of thoſe whom it is to Rule. And, when the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48725:87"/> intereſt of publick peace ſo viſibly concurreth with the intereſt of ſaving ſouls; it will hardly become the profeſſion of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom, not to truſt God, for the ſucceſs of that which is deſigned upon ſo Chriſtian conſiderations.</p>
               <p>This is the place where the firſt Service ended, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">Of that which goes before the Preface, in our Communion Service.</note> began, in the antient Church. The Creed follows after the Sermon, in <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> who, writing a little before the Council at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is the firſt that mentions it in the Service. Hee calls it an Hymn: and wee may call it the Catholick Hymn; glorifying God for the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, with his whole Church. That which wee call <hi>the ſecond Service,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing immediately hereupon, was nothing but the Euchariſt, and the prayers of the Church which it is to bee celebrated with. And that is the reaſon, why I do not think our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service ſufficient for thoſe Aſſemblies, in which the firſt is too long to hee uſed. For, the Office ought to conſiſt of Pſalmes, and Leſſons, with Hymnes interpoſed; of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and of the Euchariſt; with the prayers which it is celebrated with. Now it hath been always the uſe of Chriſts Whole Church, even from the Apoſtles, to offer, at the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, both the Bread and Wine which it is to bee conſecrated of: and alſo, what their hearts moved them to contribute, for the maintenance of Gods Service. And therefore, the Prayer for the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church is here proper, in regard of thoſe that offer to that purpoſe; the reſt that offer not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with their prayers, to that effect for which they offer. The confeſſion of ſins afore the Euchariſt is ſeen in ſome of the antient Liturgies; nor do I find it queſtioned on any hand, as either unſeaſonable, or not requiſite in this Action. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue and Anſwers; which, ſince Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Communion Service with; ſeem more proper to be placed here, to branch forth the particulars of thoſe ſins which wee confeſs. For the Commandments are certain heads, to which men may refer the ſins, for which they ask pardon, and grace to avoid them. But there is great reaſon, why they are not found in the Service of the antient Church. The reaſon is, becauſe the Decalogue is proper to the Law, and unproper to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and it is a ſad effect hereof which wee ſee. For it is certain, and manifeſt, that the Sabbatarian error hath had the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48725:87"/> riſe, or increaſe, from the conſtruction, which ignorant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have made, of the prayer for remiſſion of ſins againſt this fourth Commandment, which the Church preſcribeth. Nor have I ever found any authority of the Church, for uſing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, for the Rule by which the ſins of Chriſtians are to bee ranked; but only in ſome late Offices, of thoſe ages, which wee, who profeſs the Reformation, are not to own?</p>
               <p>After the confeſſion of ſins, the <hi>General Preface,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows<note place="margin">Of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, and the Prayers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</note> after <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> would bee inlarged, with thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, for making the World and man, for not forſaking man having forſaken him, when hee was made Lord of his Creatures; but firſt ſending the Fathers, to reclaim their ſeveral Ages, then giving the Law and the Prophets, to inſtruct his own people in his ſervice; And, when theſe means took not the effect which hee ſought, for ſending his Son to redeem and reconcile us to him, by the death of his Croſs. After this the Proper Prefaces, and the Seraphims Hymn, are of too antient and general uſe in the Catholick Church, to bee omitted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mark of Apoſtaſie from the devotion of it, which they expreſs. The Prayer which wee conſecrate with ſeemeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the intent of Gods Church; but more agreeable, in that form which the firſt Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. revived by the Scotiſh Liturgy, preſcribeth. And that Memorial, or Prayer of Oblation, which is there preſcribled, to follow, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Conſecration, is certainly more proper there, then after the Communion, ending with the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Peace, after that. For, this is the form of the whole Church, ſo conſtant, and ſo uniform, that I am thereby perſwaded, that the cloſe of it; <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, the the Power and the Glory, for ever and ever;</hi> being alwaies frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church, either in terms, or in ſubſtance, in this place; upon that occaſion, afterwards, came to bee put into the Copies of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel. For it is well enough known, how many antient Copies, and Commentaries, have it not. But there is not any of the antient Liturgies, that hath not ſome form of <hi>Doxology</hi> in this place, either in the ſame terms, or to the ſame purpoſe. And ſeeing it is manifeſt, that the Kiſs of Peace is an Apoſtolical cuſtom; and uſed in the Weſtern Church before the Communion; (though before the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48725:88"/> Conſecration, in other places) though the Ceremony bee ſet aſide, in regard of the change of times and cuſtoms, it ſhould not ſeem burthenſome, that the Chriſtianity is remembred, which it expreſſeth.</p>
               <p>But if my Opinion might paſs, I would not reſt contented<note place="margin">Of the Prayer of Oblation, and the place of it.</note> herewith. I would enlarge this Memoral, with all the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal heads of our Litanies, which might ſeem to comprize the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of all eſtates, and conditions in the Church; according to that meaſure which the Time would allow. For this would bee the offering of Chriſts ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of all Chriſtian people; which the whole Church of Chriſt hath alwaies frequented, from the beginning, without any pretenſe of ſacrificing him again; no reaſon requiring any more, then to commemorate that ſacrifice. And here would there bee room for all private and publick neceſſities, as well of the Church and Kingdom, of the Dioceſe, Province, and Country, and the reſpective Governours thereof; as of the Congregration, and of any particular member of it: and that according to ſuch Order, as the Ordinary may find cauſe to give, in caſes that do indeed require a proviſion for the Time. The antients, celebrating the Euchariſt every day, had, by that means, daily opportunity of interceding for particular neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> order; for, ſuch <hi>interceſſions</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

They that conſider not the defect which follows upon the decay of this order, are ready to impute the defect that is found, of forms of <hi>interceſſion</hi> for particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, to the preſcribing of ſet forms, by the Church; not allowing the arbitrary fanſies of Curates. But hee that hath known the manifold folly, &amp; malice, that our <hi>London</hi> Pulpits have vented; taking upon them to intercede for what occaſions they think fit, in what form they pleaſe; will find it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to redeem the ſcorne that our profeſſion ſuffers from ſuch diſorders, by baniſhing thoſe Prayers out of the Pulpit. And becauſe the Communion will not bee renewed ſo frequent, as to meet with all thoſe occaſions, which, in the Antient Church, it did ſerve for; It muſt needs bee a Chriſtian deſign, to enlarge the firſt and daily Service with ſuch forms, as may ſerve for moſt of ſuch occaſions; preventing the offenſes which have been. For, the hope of prevailing with God, for that which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48725:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> preſſeth particular perſons, is the charity of the Congregation, in equally deſiring the neceſſities of all Chriſtians. When the Euchariſt was celebrated upon ſome particular occaſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of the antient Church; it appears, that the general form was throughly obſerved, the particular occaſion only mentioned. The Eloquence, whereby the Church hoped to prevail which God, was the devotion, and unity, which it celebrated the Sacrament with.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48725:89"/> appears to be the viſible Order of the whole Church, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; or the neceſſary conſequence thereof, in this eſtate. For, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> obliging all to hear Maſs; all Sunday and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-mornings; and, the Reformation of the Abuſes, which wee proteſt againſt in the Maſs, conſiſting in reſtoring the Euchariſt; the Reformation will not bee able to juſtifie it ſelf in this point, till there bee a proviſion, that all may communicate, as they ought to do. And, for the commemoration of the dead, in the Oblation; though the Reformation under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> do ſilence it, yet under <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. it was retained. And they who were gratified afterwards by ſilencing it, do now demand, as for Reformation, that the Euchariſt bee not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon tender conſciences, for fear they ſhould not have room enough, for their arbitary Sermons and Prayers; which, they can never ſecure the Church, that they ſhall agree with the Profeſſion of it. What they will demand next, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, how ſhall it appear? For the ſtandard of tender conſciences is as inviſible, as that of <hi>Venners</hi> ſpirit, that made the riſing for King Jeſus: And, having a viſible Rule in the conſent of the Whole Church; it will bee either want of skill, or want of charity, not to diſtinguiſh the remembrance of the dead, which the Whole Church hath alwaies frequented, from the opinion of Purgatory, and the cuſtom of praying to the Saints, which ſucceeding Ages have added. But, in the mean time, the reaſon is viſible why the Communion Service is to bee ſaid at the Communion Table, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender conſciences; which, perhaps, many that mean well do not perceive. If Chriſtian people, being ſeduced by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Teachers, cannot bee made ſenſible of their duty, in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Communion; the Church is not to forbear calling them to it, and putting them in mind of it. Weeſee there are thoſe, who will needs bee <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that have miniſtred no Communion to their Churches, in ſo many years.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48725:89"/> that lies upon the publick, to reduce the Law of the Catholick Church, which is Gods Law, into force? What hope of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, if the mark bee once blotted out? So much it concerns, to hold up a daily Proteſtation, of the Right and Duty of the Church; and a Conteſtation, with all publick perſons in the Church and State, to bend the utmoſt of their endeavours, to redeem ſuch an inconſequence and <hi>indecorum</hi> in Gods Service, as the ſilencing of the principal Office in it. And wee are alive, at this day, by Gods goodneſs, to call God and man to witneſs; that, if Order bee not taken in ſo great a concernment, the fault will bee chargeable on thoſe that do not their parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, at the great day of Judgement.</p>

That is, to divide the Service of God, on Sunday and Holiday Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, into two Aſſemblies, as it ſtands divided into two Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; That all Houſholders may ſtand accountable for their whole Families, to ſee that they ſerve God in the Church, all Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Holiday Mornings; as before the Reformation, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were obliged to do. For though, by the preſent Law, there is not proviſion for all Chriſtians to communicate; Yet is there Order for the Service of God, by Pſalms, and Leſſons, mixed with Hymns, and by the Common Prayers of the Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſummed up in the Litanies. And they, who ſhall have performed it, ſhall have celebrated the Lords day, or Feſtival, with it; though not ſo like a Chriſtian, as, had hee been at the celebrating of the Euchariſt. The Communion Service might ſerve as it is, for the ſecond Aſſembly; provided that it bee, for the reaſons premiſed, at the Communion Table. The Homily or Sermon after the Goſpel; compriſing that Inſtruction, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which is neceſſary for all Chriſtians; would eaſily come within one quarter of an hour; were Curates, by the wiſdom and diligence of their Ordinaries, reſtrained from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, and held to their duties. The Common Prayers of the Church; which are perfectly ſummed up in the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; if they were uſed at this Aſſembly alſo, they would make the Service of God as compleat, as the abſence of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48725:90"/> would allow; being the principal Office of it. And this is no more then is required by the eighteenth of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths Injunctions.</hi> For as the Litanies, being uſed after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as that Injunction requireth, would bee the compleat Prayer of Oblation, according to that which hath been ſaid; So when the Euchariſt is not celebrated, the Common Prayers of the Church, for all neceſſities of all eſtates of Chriſts Church, would bee as compleatly offered to God, by the Litanies, as they ought to bee offered when the Euchariſt is not celebrated. And this courſe would take away ſome appearances of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, ariſing from the change of time, and the difference which it hath produced, in the uſe of thoſe Services of which our Office conſiſteth; which, becauſe common reaſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not, therefore the people may check at; And yet Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may not, perhaps, find ſufficient cauſe to make any change, for the removing of them. The extream length of the Office, as now it is uſed, is to bee counted in the number of theſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in that caſe, there would bee no neceſſity of a Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sermon; which now bringeth this viſible inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that the Prayer <hi>for all ſtates of Chriſts Church,</hi> which is to follow next after the Sermon, goeth before the Sermon alſo. For that Prayer, which the LV. Canon enjoyneth, is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame effect with that which is to follow after the Sermon, for <hi>the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church.</hi> As for other arbitrary prayers, before or after Sermons, wee are all witneſſes, what a Trumpet they were of the late Civil War; what a means to prepare the minds of people to it. And therefore if, after ſo freſh experience, the State ſhall ſuffer the Church to leave any room for them, in the Order of Gods Service; the State as well as the Church muſt bee <hi>felo de ſe</hi> in doing it: And they that ſhall inſiſt upon ſuch demands, do neither more nor leſs, then ask leave to do the ſame again.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is eaſie to foreſee an appearance of inconvenience, that<note place="margin">An Objection in it, anſwered.</note> might be objected, if this courſe ſhould bee put in practiſe. For, when the Euchariſt is not celebrated, the Litanies then muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low next after the Prayer for <hi>the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church;</hi> The ſubſtance whereof is the ſame that is repeated again in the Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as containing more briefly the ſum of that, which, in them, is branched out into more particulars.

                  </gap>; That is to ſay; The Deacon <hi>bidding the people pray</hi> for the neceſſities of the Church, which hee did name to them from point to point. That this is the meaning of the Canon, wee underſtand by all the Eaſtern Liturgies. For there is none of them in which the ſame Prayer is not repeated, again and again; the Deacon inditing to the people the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which they are to pray for, ſometimes more briefly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more at large. And in one of them, namely, the Latine Copy of S. <hi>Baſils</hi> Liturgy, they are expreſly called the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the <hi>third Litanees.</hi> Thus ancient is the Cuſtome of <hi>bidding Prayer</hi> in the Church.

And hereby it appeareth, that it was then thought no inconvenience, that thoſe Common Prayers of the Church ſhould bee repeated more then once. For, being the chief act of their Aſſemblies, and the end for which the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt was celebrated; To wit, that, by the memory of Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice upon the Croſs, all the neceſſities of his Church might be rendred recommendable to God; It is no marvel that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon them more then once. And therefore, if, in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Chriſtianity, the continual Celebration of the Euchariſt cannot bee revived; in the next place it remains, that theſe Common Prayers bee maintained and frequented with as much devotion, as, in ſo wretched times as wee ſee, can bee obtained. I have ſaid nothing of that which is commonly called <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or of any proviſion for it; Becauſe I ſay nothing of the Firſt Service, and of the uſe of it at other times, beſides <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Holiday</hi> Mornings. But it is eaſie for mee to ſay, that there will bee as much opportunity for it in the afternoons, as the abilities of the generality of Preachers can bee thought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to imploy, with that which ſhall bee fit to entertain the people. I know the general opinion inclines, to imploy that time with the Expoſition of the <hi>Catechiſme.</hi> But the Doctrine of the <hi>Catechiſme</hi> is the work of that time, when mens wits are at the beſt.

Whereas indeed, and in truth, the Moral Precepts of Gods Natural Law, though of greateſt conſequence to the everlaſting eſtate of immortal
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48725:91"/> Souls, (which the Law ſuppoſeth, rather then expreſſeth) are onely the matter of the Carnal Covenant, which contracteth not for the doing of them, out of that reaſon, and with that intent, which God requireth: becauſe it contracteth not for the world to come, wherewith that intent is rewardable. For, as the keeping of the precepts materially, qualified that people for the Land of Promiſe; ſo, the keeping of them in <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and for his Service,</hi> qualified them then for Heaven, as Chriſtians; always ſuppoſing the expectation of Chriſts coming, for the redemption of Gods people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it bee neceſſary for Divines, under Chriſtianity, to diſtinguiſh between <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; yet they will confound the ground of that diſtinction, as it took place under the Law, to Gods people, if they expect, that the letter of the Law ſhould expreſs it.</p>

Whereas, by that which I have ſaid, it may appear, that the miſtake which our Lord corrects, in the meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What can bee more manifeſt then this, in the Preface to it?<note place="margin">The meaning of the firſt Commandment, in this ſenſe.</note> Can Chriſtians ſay truly, that God ever delivered them <hi>out of the Land of Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>the bondage of it?</hi> muſt they not all ſay, that God hath delivered them from the bondage of ſin and Satan, correſpondent to it? might not all true Iſraelites, in whom was no guile, ſay the ſame, in regard of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Idols, which all other Nations were enſlaved with, and the ſin to which it engaged? therefore a Jew underſtands this firſt precept to bee the chief point of his Law; that hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg but one God, but that one whom his Fathers knew. And if the Mater bee examined, it will appear, that both Jews and Mahumetans ſtand at diſtance with Chriſtians, upon this falſe pretenſe; that the Faith of the holy Trinity agreeth not herewith. For the <hi>Alcoran</hi> inſinuateth this poyſon every where. But the Chriſtian goes farther in the meaning of this precept; And, believing the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, to bee that one God which gave them this precept; believes himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the bondage of ſin, by the blood of the Son, and by the Grace of the Spirit: And therefore, making the will of God the ground, and his glory and ſervice the intent of all his doings, renounces all reſpect to the pleaſure, or profit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and greatneſs of this World, ſo far as it is not the means to ſerve God; Acknowledging, that, when hee declines from this reſolution, hee makes his <hi>Belly his God,</hi> or <hi>his riches his Idol,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; or rather the Devil; that offers him ſome little part of that, which our Lord refuſed in groſs; the God whom hee worſhips.</p>

For, ſeeing it is manifeſt, how much Idolatry was advanced by Imagery, (though it may bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) there can bee no marvel, that there ſhould bee a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar precept againſt it. Wherefore, it is manifeſt, that Jews, by the letter of this precept, are tied from all Images, which their Elders, who had the power of limiting what is lawful, and what is not, by the Law, ſhould declare to bee unlawful. But to think that their declarations ought to bind Chriſtians, were to imagine that Chriſtians ought to bee Jews. And, the letter of the Law forbidding all Images, at all times and in all places, as well as ſome; it is not poſſible to ſhow, how Chriſtians can bee tied from any kind of Image, at any time, or in any place, more then others, by the letter of this precept. But, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of the precept, implied in the negative which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth; <hi>thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them;</hi> Chriſtians muſt needs find themſelves bound to that worſhip of God, in ſpirit and truth, which, it is not poſſible for Jews to think themſelves tied to, in conſideration of the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And therefore, having the Word of God for the rule of their worſhip, muſt needs condemn the worſhipping of God, by any imagination of their own deviſing, for ſuperſtition and will-worſhip; In ſtanding upon that, which God declareth not that hee regardeth, for the diſcharge of their duty to him: and in tendring him things of their own chuſing, for the worſhip which they acknowledge to bee due. For, as I ſaid afore, it is not poſſible, that they who lay ſuch a weight of their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, upon things of their own choiſe, ſhould diſcharge the duty of worſhipping him in ſpirit and truth, in that meaſure, which the compariſon of Gods will with our own choiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. And by this rule wee condemn all exceſſes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in honouring the Saints, and their Reliques, or Images; without making our ſelves obnoxious to the Jews, for any reaſon to do it with. For, Chriſtianity having put Idolatry to flight, which the Law never pretended to do; It is not to bee imagined, that the having of Images can make a man take thoſe things for God, which they repreſent, ſo long as the belief of Chriſtianity is alive at the heart. For neither was it Idolatry, though it were a breach of this Commandment, for a Jew to have ſuch Images, as were forbidden by their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48725:93"/> not taking that for God which they repreſented. But, what honour of Saints departed, or what ſigns of that honour, Chriſtianity may require; what furniture or ceremonies the Churches of Chriſtians, and the publique worſhip of God in them may require, now all the World profeſſes Chriſtianity, and muſt honour the Religion which they profeſs; this the Church is at freedom to determine, by the word of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the beſt agreement of Chriſtians. For neither is it obliged by the ſecond Council of <hi>Nicaea,</hi> or the violent proceedings of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which have brought it into force in theſe Weſtern parts; nor to the exceſſes of the adverſe parties in the Eaſt, which made the ſetting up and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing of Images in Churches to bee Idolatry, without ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground in the Scriptures for it.</p>
               <p>Confining the literal intent of the Decalogue, to thoſe groſs<note place="margin">Of the third Commandment.</note> ſins, by which, all Jews were to underſtand, that the intereſt of the Nation in the Land of Promiſe muſt become forfeited, as all reaſon requireth; the taking of <hi>Gods name in vain,</hi> in the third Commandment, is, in plain terms, to ſwear that which is falſe, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe renders it. But a Chriſtian <hi>takes up Gods name</hi> in profeſſing Chriſtianity. And, when the World ſees him do any thing that agreeth not with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, without doubt, hee takes it up in vain: For there never was any true Iſraelite, in whom was no guile, that worſhipped God in ſpirit and truth, but hee might then underſtand that hee took Gods name in vain; if, profeſſing the worſhip of the only true God, hee ſhould live like thoſe that worſhipped Idols. Much more a Chriſtian, knowing that hee is bound to direct all his actions to the end of Gods glory and ſervice, out of obedience to his declared will; muſt needs know, that he ſhall not bee guiltleſs to God, if they bee not ſuitable to the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hee weareth.</p>

Others think, that hee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48725:93"/> it from the beginning, for a day of his Service; though the reſt which the Jews were commanded, ſitting ſtill all the Sabbath, came in force from the giving of the Law. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the memory of the ſeven days of the week, which hath been preſerved among all nations; who cannot bee thought to have learned any matter of Religion from the Jews; ſeems to intimate a Tradition of the creation, remaining among them. But it is to bee conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, when Idolatry prevailed, the worſhip of the ſeven Planets was a prime part of it: and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which appropriates the ſeven days of the week to them, a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great means of propagating the ſame. And therefore, the memory of the creation being obliterated, by the ſuperſtition which the Devil had graffed upon it; the obſervations of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people are rather to bee imputed to this, then to that. And otherwiſe, there is nothing in the Scripture to anſwer <hi>Tertullian</hi> with; demanding of the Jews, which of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, before the Law, kept the Sabbath. But howſoever, if wee bee Chriſtians, wee muſt not queſtion, that the bleſſing which God <hi>hallowed the ſeventh day with,</hi> is the reſt of Chriſts body in the grave on that day; by which, that reſt from the travel of ſin, and the puniſhment of it, which Chriſtianity profeſſeth and promiſeth, was purchaſed for Chriſtians. For, upon this ground, all the time of the Goſpel is that <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which the Jewiſh Sabbath ſignified. And the fulfilling of the fourth Commandment, is the reſt of a Chriſtian from <hi>all his own works, all the days of his life.</hi> Not that I doubt, that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, the day was to bee ſet apart for the Offices of Gods Service; but becauſe there are other precepts of the Law, <hi>Num.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>Levit.</hi> XXIII. by which that is provided for. By virtue of which precepts, according to the correſpondence between the Law and Goſpel, not only the firſt day of the week is ſet aſide by the Apoſtles, for the ſervice of God, inſtead of the ſeventh day, which the Jews obſerve; but alſo other days of Aſſemblies, being appointed by the Church, are to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Gods people, for the ſame reaſon as the ſeventh. For even the ſeventh day it ſelf was obſerved, and was to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Chriſtians, for the ſame reaſon, ſo long as the cuſtom of the Church required them to obſerve it for that purpoſe. Beſides, the letter of the Law having forbidden any work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Otherwiſe it is true, which <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ſo often chargeth, that they could not aſſemble, without ſome breach upon the ſtrict ſenſe of that command; <hi>not to ſtir out of their place</hi> on that day.

               <p>When the fifth Commandment promiſeth long life, to them<note place="margin">The meaning of the fifth, as to Chriſtians.</note> that <hi>honour Father and Mother;</hi> will any man ſay, that this promiſe is made to Chriſtians; that profeſs to take up Chriſts Croſs, and to lay down their lives for Chriſt? If hee do, let him ſay, what Land it is which Chriſtians are promiſed; If it bee not the Land of the living; which the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> figureth? Wherefore it is manifeſt, that the honours due to the King, and all Civil Powers under him, are due by the letter of this precept, as properly comprized in the name of <hi>Father,</hi> according to the uſe of that language. The obedience alſo, due to the Elders of the Synagogue, is, by the Metaphorical ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>Mother;</hi> ſtanding for the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> derived from the terms of this precept. But, according to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between Chriſtianity and Judaiſm; God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our Mother is the Church. And therefore, as in temporal and civil things, hee is a rebell that honours not the King; ſo, in matters of Religion, hee is an Apoſtate from the Church, that honours not the commands of it, within thoſe bounds, which the command of God limiteth. And thus, the ſive firſt Commandments; according to the method of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, abridging an infinite number of Jewiſh Obſervations into one very weighty precept; enjoyn every one of them the whole duty of a Chriſtian to God; the acknowledging and worſhipping of the only true God extending it ſelf to living as a Chriſtian, to reſting from the works of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the honour of God, by keeping his Commandments, as they are delivered to us by his Church.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48725:94"/>
               <p>The four Precepts that follow are under one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,<note place="margin">The meaning of the five last, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſtianity.</note> in this place. Murther, Adultery, Theft, and falſe Witneſs, are things, that either take away, or abridge the intereſt of particular Jews, in the Land of Promiſe. And, if the publique were acceſſory to the multiplying of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the publique intereſt thereof in Gods promiſes muſt needs become queſtionable. Among Chriſtians, ſeeing theſe are crimes which cannot conſiſt with any intereſt in the world to come; the very firſt motions of them are commanded to bee ſuppreſſed and mortified. And certainly, whoſoever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a Jew in ſpirit did underſtand himſelf bound to abſtain from them, not for fear of puniſhment, but for love of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which love, the love which Chriſt hath prevented us with advanceth to that height, which Chriſtianity profeſſeth. But this obligeth us to aſſign the laſt Commandment a meaning by it ſelf, diſtinct from all that which is prohibited by the former precepts. And truly, hee that finds not the peculiar Law of the Jews, in the prohibition of <hi>coveting another mans wife,</hi> muſt bee ſtrangely tranſported with prejudice. For, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery being prohibited afore; coveting another mans wife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee underſtood, but by ſowing ſeeds of diſſentions, and other ways of inticing, whereby a man may ſeek to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans wife his own, by the Law of the Jews; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a man, to put away a wife that pleaſed him not. And therefore, the reſt of the precept muſt bee <hi>weighed in the ſame Balance;</hi> to forbid any way of fraud, or force, whereby a man may make his neighbours goods his own. Therefore the mater of this precept is expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">

And the Jews reduce the precepts of not <hi>coveting,</hi> or <hi>luſting,</hi> under the title of <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Maimoni.</hi> And therefore, whether you reſtrain St. <hi>Pauls thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,</hi> Rom. VII. 7. to that which this precept forbiddeth; or enlarge it to that which is forbidden by the other four; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are, by this precept, forbidden to entertain any motion of luſt towards that which is another mans. And St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that the ſum of the Law is comprized in the firſt precept, commanding the love of God, and the laſt, forbidding concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; is fully verified, underſtanding the love of God to bee commanded by all the five precepts; compriſing, all of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48725:95"/> them, the whole duty of a Chriſtian to God; But the Love of a mans Neighbour, by the other five; forbidding any luſt toward a mans own advantage, by another mans diſadvantage. And ſo you ſee, what a Chriſtian prays for, in praying to God to have mercy upon him, for any thing, wherein hee hath offended againſt any precept of his Law, for the paſt: and to give him Grace to keep it for the future. In particular, for the fourth Commandment; that, if hee will pray as a Chriſtian ſhould pray, hee muſt pray to God to have mercy upon him, in whatſoever hee hath not reſted from the works of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> begging Grace to do it for the future.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48725:95"/> concerning the diſcipline of the Clergy: The other is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſequence of the like Canon; in this eſtate, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſetled by the Law of the Kingdom; concerning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the People. The former is the Reſtoring of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Whole Church, which confineth all Orders of the Clergy to their reſpective Churches. In the Language of this time, it ſignifieth the voiding of all Privileges to hold Church preferment in more Dioceſes then one. It is the evident conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Order which the Whole Church hath derived from the Act of the Apoſtles themſelves; conſtituting ſeveral Cities, and the Territories thereof, the ſeats of ſeveral Churches and their Dioceſes. It is manifeſt that this Order was in force, (though in a diverſe meaſure in divers Countries) from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, all over Chriſtendom: And that with the like reſpect to the Churches of Mother Cities, in all Provinces. It is alſo manifeſt, that the Canon grounded upon this Order was in force, till the Uſurpation of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeking Benefices for their creatures all over Chriſtendom, authorized the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of it, by privileges, the greateſt benefit whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enjoyed. So that, the ſurceaſing of it being an abuſe of the Papacy, our profeſſing of Reformation requires the reſtoring of it.</p>
               <p>But, the reſtoring of it will ſignifie more, then the terms of<note place="margin">Of inferior Orders in the Clergy, and their Offices.</note> it expreſs. It will infer the reſtoring of ſome part of that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſcipline of the Clergy, upon which, the credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof, with and over the People, from the beginning of Chriſtianity, was grounded. It is well enough known, how very antiently, how very generally, inferior Orders of Clergy were inſtituted by the Church, under the Hierarchy founded by the Apoſtles, for a ſenſe to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule; that <hi>no Novice</hi> ſhould bee <hi>Ordained.</hi> For, when Chriſtianity was propagated all over; then, thoſe that had lived meer Lay-men all their lives might as well bee counted Novices in Chriſtianity, compared with them that were grown up from their youth in theſe inferior Orders, as thoſe that were newly converted to Chriſtianity in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time. The imployment of theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; in Reading the Leſſons, in ſinging the Pſalms, in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the perſon of the Biſhop, and the Orders of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48725:96"/> but an exerciſe for the time. The exerciſe of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, their meekneſs and patience, their ſobriety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in a mean condition; living upon ſome ſmall pittance, which the ſtock of the Church was able to allow, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the poor; was that which made them fit to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to higher degrees. The ſtudy of the Scriptures was the imployment of the time that remained to ſpare, from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon theſe Miniſteries. For, as for other ſtudies, while Idolatry continued in credit in the World, it was gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuſpected for ſcandalous, to ſtudy the learning which Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters had brought forth.</p>
               <p>True it is, many of them, not being book-learned, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe content with ſo Religious a poverty: and living ſometimes by<note place="margin">The converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergy, and the uſe of Church goods.</note> their hand-work, (that they might charge the Church the leſs) as well as upon their pittances, looked not after higher degrees. Others, imbracing a Religious life, and having means for their ſupport, thought it a ſcandal to their profeſſion, to receive any thing from the Church; knowing that what they ſpared muſt come to the poor. And generally, innumerable of all Orders, eſpecially Biſhops and Prieſts, taking upon them their Orders, gave up their eſtates to charitable uſes. For it was ſcandalous for thoſe that gave them not up, to live otherwiſe, then thoſe, that had nothing to maintain them but the allowance of the Church, did live. But, to increaſe their eſtates out of Church goods was a thing which the Canons not only prohibited, but made void. For all Canons, from the Canon of the Apoſtles, to thoſe at this day, in force in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſable the Clergy to diſpoſe of Church goods by laſt Will and Teſtament. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing of the Clergy to Marry, brought in upon conſideration of very great neceſſity, muſt needs derogate from the obligation of this Rule, in point of Conſcience. For, it muſt needs infer a Right to provide for Wives and Children, which the Church alloweth, out of Church goods. But it can by no means abrogate the ſame, without altering the State of the Clergy; (profeſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement from the World beyond other Chriſtians,) without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the Intereſt of the poor in the goods of the Church; both of them ſubſiſting by Gods Law, and therefore by no means to bee extinguiſhed. And therefore, it is requiſite that the Maried Clergy content themſelves, with a ſober mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48725:96"/> and proviſion, for themſelves, and the diſpoſing of their Children in the World, without converting the goods of the Church to raiſe them eſtates. For it is utterly a miſtake to think, that Church goods were provided, to the end that the Clergy might equal the port of their parallel Rankes in the Laity, in expenſe. It is much againſt the intent of the Canons, that the Clergy ſhould maintain familiarity with the Laity, by correſpondences in entertainments, or other occaſions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous converſation; ſuch as their Office bringeth not forth. For, that <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> which Parſonages, and other Benefices are chargeable with, is not the entertainment of their equals among the Laity; but the providing for the diſtreſſed wayfar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or thoſe that are from home upon ſuch occaſions, as chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requireth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſupport: beſides the caſual neceſſities of the poor, either at home; that would attend upon the ſervice of God, but that their honeſt labour will not bear them out in it; or abroad, that appear to bee in preſent diſtreſs, whatſoever the occaſion may bee, that puts them to try the charity of Chriſtians. In fine, there is nothing more contrary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Clergy, then too great indifference in converſing with the Laity, of what rank ſoever. For, the authority which ought to bee in them, for the adviſing, exhorting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing, and reproving of all ſorts of People; whom their ranks may call them to converſe with, upon occaſions which their Office either breedeth, or alloweth; ſtands upon this ground; that voluntary familiarity engages them not any way to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thoſe actions, which they ſhould rather diſcountenance.</p>
               <p>And this was the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ground for the Rule of promoting the<note place="margin">The ground for promotions to higher degrees.</note> Clergy to higher degrees: and in fine, to the Biſhopricks of their reſpective Churches. For it is true, by the leave of the Biſhop, being diſmiſſed, they might hold their degree in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church. But the expectation of being promoted lay in the trial that they gave of themſelves; and in their merit from their own Church. No man could pretend any thing to it, in any other Church, Regularly.

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48725:97"/> True it is, it was diſpenſed in upon great occaſions. But every privilege is an exception to a Law. Always, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which every one did his Church was that which intitled him to the nomination of the Clergy, to the ſuffrage or approbation of the people, to the conſent of the Suffragant Biſhops; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Metropolitane. This was, and will bee always, the Catholick form of electing Biſhops. The intereſt of the Crown is well enough conſiſtent with it; providing a Negative for it; that any man may bee refuſed, whom the Crown ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. The dependence of the People upon their Biſhops, which the intereſt of Chriſtianity neceſſarily requires, cannot bee maintained otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The means to bring this education of the Clergy, and by conſequence, the diſcipline grounded upon it, out of uſe, is<note place="margin">The Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to ſome part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> ſaid to bee the erecting of Univerſities in theſe Weſtern parts of Chriſtendom. For this was, without queſtion, a far ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to the knowledge of the Scriptures, the Canons, and the Rites and Cuſtoms of the Church. But it was the way alſo to looſe that gravity, that ſobriety, that abſtinence and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon which the credit of the Clergy with the people had been raiſed. And by that time, or rather long before, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the chief Guides of the Church muſt needs have rendred inferior degrees conformable. It is not my meaning, to inſiſt upon the reſtoring of the antient Diſcipline; which nothing but the wiſdom of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods Spirit, and Tradition from the Apoſtles, could have furniſhed the ſimplicity of the Primitive Chriſtians with. The Diſcipline of the Univerſities may bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church, may it be recovered from that licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſobedience, which Anarchy hath privileged in youth. I inſiſt upon that which I have propoſed already, though no heed is given to it. The general Rule of the Church, to found Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks in Cities, was not every where obſerved in <hi>England.</hi> Some Dioceſes are ſo large, that the Cathedral Churches cannot bee made ſerviceable, under the Biſhop, to the Government of the Whole Dioceſe. If Colleges of Presbyters were erected in all the Head Towns of Counties, the youth of the Counties that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Clergy, reſtoring this Canon, muſt bee under the inſpection of the ſame. If, before their going to the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they were liſted under them, as expecting imployment and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48725:97"/> maintenance under them; that is, within the County; then muſt they make account to approve their converſations and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to them, as having no other way to live, in that eſtate to which they addict themſelves. As for the courſe of finding imployment and maintenance for them, I will go no further to particulars, then I have done. It is enough, that the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould bee, the reſtoring of the Primitive Canons, as the eſtate of this time will require, or allow.</p>
               <p>It would bee no ſmall gain, that, by reſtoring this Canon,<note place="margin">Reaſons for it.</note> the complaint of pluralities would bee ſilenced. For, that perſons, whoſe abilities and truſt are approved to the Biſhop, by information of the ſaid Presbyters, ſhould have the care of more then one Church; would bee no more inconvenience, then that thoſe Presbyters have a care of the County, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Dioceſe.

I will ſay no more to juſtifie this Propoſition, but this; That hee who is obnoxious to ſeveral Churches; that is, to ſeveral Dioceſes; either as to the duty of Governing, or of being Governed, can by no means bee accountable to both; according to that account, which the conſtitution of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church requireth, of every Order and Degree of the Clergy. And again, that, ſeeing all exemptions, privileging againſt the Ordinary Rule and Government of the Church, are the effects and conſequences of the Papacy, and the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations thereof; that the Reformation which wee profeſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee juſtified in it ſelf, (though, in compariſon, it may abate of the abuſe which went afore) without reſtoring a Rule of ſuch conſequence.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48725:98"/> when their lives and liberties are ſaved, till they ſatisfie the Church, of their converſion to God. The Law of this Land, providing no other trial for ſins of uncleanneſs, but that of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, hath hitherto enabled them to proceed to the trial of publick ſcandals, by depoſing witneſſes <hi>ex officio.</hi> Which, according to the reſt of the ignorance and malice of the bleſſed Reformation; hath been conſtrued for an Uſurpation upon the liberties of Chriſtian people. For it is manifeſt, that, under the Old Teſtament, the Rulers of Gods antient people were able, every one within the Sphere of his authority, to oblige all men to anſwer upon Oath, in any thing, wherein, they ſhould adjure them to anſwer. For upon this account, our Lord himſelf, beeing ſubject to the Law, anſwered the adjuration of the High Prieſt. And the Levitical Law preſcribeth a treſpaſs Offering for him, who, being adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak his knowledge, in any buſineſs, ſhould conceal it. This, the Jews extend to the adjurations of private perſons, if made in open Court. But there is no queſtion, that the Princes and Judges of that People, each in the mater of his Office, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged their Inferiors to anſwer their knowledg; So that they were perjured <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> concealing that which they knew of any mans cauſe. Under the Goſpel, it is evident, that the Biſhop, in Conſiſtory with his Presbyters, did try all ſcandals in the Church, by ſummoning all perſons within the Dioceſe, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their knowledge. And that to this effect; That if any man were detected to have concealed his knowledge, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came thereby liable to Penance, as for a heinous ſin. And <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, authorizing by an Act of the Empire, yet extant, the Sentences of Biſhops, in all cauſes, that ſhould bee brought to them by conſent of parties; gives this reaſon for it; Becauſe their authority was able preſently to diſcover that, which Civil Courts could not bring to light by tedious ſuits. Whereby it appeareth, that all Chriſtians found themſelves tied to anſwer the truth, which their Paſtors ſummoned them to declare, for diſcharge of their conſcience. Chriſtianity being corrupted, by the coming of the World into the Church; it might become requiſite, that the generality of this authority ſhould bee reſtrained within ſuch bounds, as emergent abuſes might oblige the Law to provide. But, when a Power ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48725:98"/> concerning Chriſtianity, is cried down for an Uſurpation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church; it appeareth that Chriſtianity is at a low ebbe, if they who underſtand ſo little in the Scriptures, or in maters concerning the Church, dare undertake to Reform it. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is one of the ſins, which the antient Church, in ſome places, durſt not warrant forgiveneſs; And therefore, did not reſtore Aulterers to the Communion, no not at the point of death. If the Law therefore provide no other trial for it, but by the Chriſtian Court; to take away that means of trial which the Church inheriteth of Gods antient people, is, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to authorize adultery in a Chriſtian Kingdom; That is, to call down Gods vengeance upon it. Rather, it ſhould bee provided, that inquiſition after all ſcandals, upon publick fame, might bee authorized, upon terms fit to prevent abuſes; though not for civil puniſhment; which the Chriſtian Court ſhould have nothing to do with; yet for the bringing of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Penance.</p>

               <p>Now it is true; Publick Penance is, and was at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, utterly ſurceaſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But private Penance was in uſe, as ſtill it continues, (though under thoſe great abuſes which I have taxed) as the prime inſtitution of our Lord and his Apoſtles; though ſeldom mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church, in compariſon of Publick Penance, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in all the primitive Fathers. For, the Chriſtian Court being afterwards divided, into the outward Court of the Church, and the inward Court of the Conſcience; (the one concerning all Juriſdiction, to any effect of Excommunication; the other concerning ſin that is not Excommunicated, becauſe not notorious, but voluntarily made known) the ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication being releaſed, a man comes not to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48725:99"/> in any caſe of ſin, till hee voluntarily undergo the Keys of the Church, by opening that ſin in this inward Court, which hee puts the outward Court to bring to light. And thus were the Keys of the Church in force, before the Reformation, under the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, were publick Penance reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then might it clearly bee ſaid, that a Reformation were effected in this point. For, Penance abſolutely ſo called, in the antient Church, is Publick Penance. Some ſins of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence were referred to ſome one of the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>byters, to bee cured in private; by the antienteſt Cuſtoms and Canons of the Church. But there is but little mention of them, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the greater that were reſtored by publick Penance. So, the reſtoring of publick Penance would bee effectively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; that is, the reſtoring of that which was; though private Penance were not enjoyned by Law. And of neceſſity, there would bee great hope, that Chriſtians, underſtanding, by the uſe of Publick Penance, the need they have of the Keys of the Church, to aſſure them the cure of their ſins; would bee moved in conſcience, voluntarily to ſeek that help, for the cure of their ſecret ſins. For, by that means firſt came private Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance into ſo general uſe, that it was poſſible for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to procure ſecret Confeſſion once a year, to bee ſetled for a Law of all Chriſtian States under it. And, did the Law here maintain publick Penance, then were the Haereſie of the Fanaticks, and all imaginations tending to any degree of it, quite put to flight; the people receiving this impreſſion from the Law, that their ſins which no man knows, but only God, cannot bee cured at an eaſier rate, then thoſe which the world knows. But as the mater is, ſo long as the Keys of the Church are not in force, that is, in uſe, for the reſtoring of ſinners to the Communion, upon preſumption that they are reſtored to Grace, grounded upon the works of Repentance which they ſhew; it is a hard task to maintain the claime of Reformation, in the Church. For the Church is founded upon the Power of the Keys. And therefore, where that Power is not in force; as, during this time of our bleſſed Reformation; there it is a Church in hope, and right, rather then in deed, and in being. Wee publickly profeſs to ſeek the reſtoring of Penance. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee have not effectively ſought that which wee profeſs to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48725:100"/> ſeek; God hath brought upon us that heavy vengeance which wee have felt. The marvellous work that hee hath ſhewed in reſtoring us, obligeth all to lay it to heart; and never to give over the thought of it, till, by degrees, it bee reſtored in ſome meaſure. Chriſtian ſouls periſh, becauſe they know not what help they want. The bleſſing of the Church, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Euchariſt, being miniſtred to all without differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; give no man any ground of ſalvation, by being allowed it. And yet the Church is provided by God, that all may have ground for that hope, by being of the Church. All that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Office, by Miniſtring the ſame, maintain ſimple ſouls in a confidence, that they want nothing requiſite. Whereas, it is not enough for our diſcharge, that any man may, unleſs there bee probable means, whereby all may bee ſaved. But that can by no means bee maintained, where the Power of the Keys is not in force.<note place="margin">What means there is left, for the reſtoring of it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The difficulty, indeed, of the buſineſs appears as much, by the ſcandals which the Scottiſh Presbyteries, and our Triers here, for the very little time they had, have given; as by thoſe which ſerved to bring Auricular Confeſſion out of date. And no marvel. For, all the cries for Diſcipline, which our Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians make, ſeem to demand; that their Power in it bee as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary as their Prayers. No Rule, no bounds, no limits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, within which it ſhall bee miniſtred; which is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Nor is it poſſible to reduce the ſeverity of the antient Canons; which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf hath abated to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Penance. And yet, ſuppoſing the premiſes, it will bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to follow them, in ſuch a form, as the World at preſent may bear; Not referring the meaſure of trial, to bee required for the verifying of a mans converſion, to the diſcretion of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or a Pariſh; but referring it to the Biſhop, and to thoſe whom hee ſhall diſcharge his burthen upon, in the Cathedral Church, in thoſe Colleges which I have propoſed, or in the Dioceſe. And yet, it ſeems neceſſary to refer the witneſſing of the effect to the Curate, and to the Pariſh. For, what can bee more reaſonable, then to preſume of a good effect, when they that ſee a mans daily converſation atteſt it? As for the meaſure; it will bee a great work, for the Synods of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, to agree upon ſuch a form, as the Legiſlative Power of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48725:100"/> the Kingdom may find cauſe to authorize, and put in force. Which were it effected, it would not ſeem unreaſonable, to truſt particular Miniſters with the cure of ſecret ſins; having a Rule before their eyes, to direct their proceeding. I ſay it would ſeem reaſonable, ſuppoſing the premiſes; ſuppoſing the Clergy lived in that reſpect to their Superiors, in that exerciſe of their Deacons degree, in that ſobriety, (furniſhing diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in valuing mens actions,) which their people may have ground to truſt their ſouls with. For at the preſent, the bleſſed Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation having ſo far perſwaded the People, that the Miniſter hath nothing to do but to preach, till they bee ſure of their ſalvation; who will marvel, that they regard not thoſe who deteſt ſuch impoſtures? Nor would this bee leſs benefit to the publick Peace, and the quiet of Superiors, even the Sovereign; Who muſt bee content to have their actions ſcanned in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, till there bee a courſe, whereby their people may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, in thoſe things which the Pulpit cannot, nor ought to decide. The Scottiſh Presbyters have made us underſtand, how well they underſtand the bounds of Eccleſiaſtical Power; how much they deſire to attempt upon the Secular, as well in the Pulpit, as in the Conſiſtory. And where this great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for the cure of ſin, and the ſalvation of ſouls, is not duly maintained, juſt is it with God, to make the neglect of it the ſeed of publick troubles; The maintenance whereof would contribute as much to the publick Peace, as to the ſalvation of ſouls.</p>

               <p>IT will not become a good Chriſtian to think much, that theſe things are called upon at this time, before this Church bee reſtored to the benefit of the Laws, which the Order thereof is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48725:101"/> to bee eſtabliſhed and inforced. It will not become any ſuch to ſay; That the ſame complaint might have been made, while the Church of <hi>England</hi> was the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and before the late breaches in it; And therefore might bee ſpared, when all ought to thanke God, that wee may bee as wee were. For, the incomparable mercy that God hath ſhewed, in reſtoring the Laws with the Crown, and the Church with both, would leave a mark of ingratitude upon him, whoſoever, having nothing to ſay againſt the truth, nothing againſt the great weight and high conſequence of the premiſes; ſhould not think it worth the pains, for all Eſtates of the Church and Kingdom, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the redreſſing of them. Eſpecially, the profeſſion of Reformation obliging all, that think Chriſtians bound to ſtand to that which they profeſs, not to reſt in that which our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had obtained, by the firſt attempt of it. For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great difficulties, which the extream factions of Papiſts and Puritans, in Church and State, had caſt in the way of all right endeavours, to perfect the Reformation begun, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ground and meaſure of it; Wee ſee what a ſevere account it hath pleaſed God to take, of all Eſtates in the Kingdom, for laying aſide the thought of perfecting that, which, in ſo high a point as that of Penance, they had acknowledged to bee defective. I do not intend to ſay, that the Sacrileges committed under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. had no hand in this account. For, there is no ſuch mark to glorifie Gods providence with, as when it is viſible, that the puniſhment ſprings out of the ſin. Nor is there any mean more viſible towards the advancing of that confuſion which wee have ſeen, then the applying of the endowment of Churches to common uſes; being found, at the diſſolution, by the irregular Power of the Papacy, in the hands of Monaſteries. But of that guilt, the Crown and Kingdom ſeems to ſtand in a good meaſure diſcharged, by reſtoring that part, which the Church ſtood inveſted of, by the ſame title, (as wee ſee they have done) to the due property; in ſuch a rate as the publick peace might indure. As for private perſons, that ſtand inveſted of the like goods by the like Title, there is reaſon to hope, that their account redoundeth not to the account of the Kingdom, in the ſight of God; notwithſtanding that the Law alloweth them to uſe their own conſcience, in owning or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48725:102"/> their Title. For, where the Unity of the Church ſeemeth to bee concerned, it hath been always the practice of the Church, to forbear the uſe of the Keys, and to admit thoſe to the Communion, whoſe actions it intendeth not to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; leaving them to anſwer God for the ſame, knowing that the Church warranteth them not. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> days, followed this patern; reconciling this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Communion thereof, without reſtitution of that wrong, which it claimed to bee done under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. But, if the Kingdom bee liable to an account, for the ſin of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons; in detaining Church goods, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by that means, hindring the ſalvation of Chriſtian people; Shall wee not think, that the neglect of perfecting the Reformation begun, though obſtructed by the difficulty which I have alleged, is, and ought to bee taken for the ground of that reckoning, which God hath made with us? And therefore, that wee are not to lay aſide the thought of it, ſo long as there appears any means of proceeding to it. Now, it ſeemeth manifeſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, that there can bee no ſuch opportunity, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Laws of the Kingdom, by which Religion is to bee eſtabliſhed; as while the minds of men, after the breaches which wee have ſeen, remain unſetled to any Order in Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For, before the breach, there is appearance enough, that all means of doing this were ſtudiouſly obſtructed, by the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan party in Parliament. And it will appear, if it bee well conſidered, that this is it that made it popular; having always juſt cauſe of complaint; (which can never bee wanting in any Civil Laws; And therefore, not in thoſe Civil Laws, whereby Religion is ſetled) but always pretending an unjuſt way of redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame.</p>
               <p>But there is a greater reaſon for us to think, that the Church<note place="margin">The reſtoring of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Laws of the Land is not the reſtoring of the Church.</note> of <hi>England</hi> will not bee reſtored, by the reſtoring of thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws of the Land, which gave force to the Order of it; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe manifeſt and notorious breaches, which wee have ſeen in it. For it is viſible, that it is the Secular power only that is acknowledged, by thoſe that return from their Schiſme, and conform themſelves to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws which it inforceth, in conſideration of the temporal reward or puniſhment, which they are inacted with. It is now found to bee the ſin of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48725:102"/> when ſuch things are impoſed upon tender conſciences, as they are offended at; Not the ſin of them who conform themſelves to that which is enjoyned. And, all that hath been pretended, for a change in the Laws, ſeems now to bee made a meer Office of Charity to the Kingdom; That it might not ſin, in impoſing upon tender conſciences, that which they were offended at; who are ſafe enough from ſinning, all the while that they ſubmit to it. In like manner, they who, to bee capable of Benefices, get to bee Ordained anew; becauſe the Ordination was void, which they had from thoſe who had nothing to do to give it; do profeſs openly enough, that they do it, not, becauſe they thought their void Orders defective; but to obtain the privileges, which the Law of the Land annexeth to that Ordination which it protecteth. At which rate, the Oath of Canonical Obedience it ſelf will tye them in conſcience, only to themſelves; That is, to avoid thoſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral penalties, which the Law puniſheth diſobeying the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with. In the mean time, the Fanaticks are owned by them upon all occaſions: And, not only the Schiſme of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations is paſſed over, for a weakneſs of tender conſciences; but, that damnable error, of aſſurance of ſalvation without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Chriſtianity; the fry that hath ſpawned all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Enthuſiaſts and Fanaticks; muſt go for a frailty of the <hi>Godly,</hi> in profeſſing the true conſequence of common Principles. And, ſeeing all ſeverity of Penalties, which may reſtrain the Licenſe of ſuch Conventicles, muſt needs inſinuate an invitation, of returning to Communion with the Church, for thoſe who would avoid them; It is much to bee conſidered, that they who ſhall return, without diſowning their Schiſme; which is of it ſelf always notorious; Or the perverſe doctrines, which have been notoriouſly owned for the ground of it; do manifeſtly bring with them their profeſſion into the Church. For, returning, only that they may avoid the temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it inferreth, they are at liberty, in point of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as of conſcience, to practice the Maxime which <hi>Michiavel</hi> teacheth; to make themſelves of that party which they intend to overthrow; as not having engaged with the Church, upon profeſſion of conſcience. It is not for nothing, that the Rules of the Church, from the beginning, have made
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48725:103"/> them Haereticks and Schiſmaticks, as to the Church, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Haereticks and Schiſmaticks. It is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that they admit them not to return, without diſowning their Schiſmes, or their Haereſies. It is not for nothing, that they admit not the Clergy, that have been involved in them, in their own Orders; But render them incapable of that truſt for the future. The reaſon for all is the ſame. The profeſſion of the mouth intitleth to the viſible privilege of the Church, in communion with it; the ſincerity thereof in the heart, to the inviſible privilege of Chriſtianity, with God. And, though there bee great reaſon to hope; that communion with the Church, and the daily uſe of it may bee a mean to reſtore the heart into a right reliſh of that, which, the diſtance that hath been cauſeth men to diſtaſte beyond meaſure; yet is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſolemnity of profeſſion, to render ſuch a change viſible. And therefore, it will not ſerve to juſtifie the common cauſe, till time render the effect notorious.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the reaſon of the diſtance, which wee hold<note place="margin">Yet are wee not, therefore, chargeable with Schiſm, by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> remains the ſame; and therefore the meaſure of it. The abuſes which created the neceſſity, for parts of the Church to Reforme themſelves, without the Whole, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame. Only wee are left without hope of amendment; ſeeing the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> received without it. So, no terms of reconcilement, but thoſe of conqueſt; which, how ſhould this Church and Kingdom bee obliged to accept of; to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of all the ſouls, which muſt needs periſh by thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes? And therefore, allowing the due value of that ſin which Schiſme ſignifieth, in the party that cauſeth it; wee ſhall not need to fear the charge of it, though both parties are viſibly in the ſtate of it. For, the Unity of the Church being next, in conſideration and weight, to the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, which the being of the Church preſuppoſeth; The Faith which only juſtifieth, is ſeen, in making good that profeſſion, which intitleth us to bee members of the Church. But that Charity, whereby that Faith is brought into effect, is ſeen, in the firſt place, in maintaining the Unity thereof; Which, a private Chriſtian maintaineth, onely by continuing a member of it. So, a Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, fails of his ſalvation, by fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which a Chriſtian profeſſeth as a Chriſtian. But a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48725:103"/> Chriſtian as a member of the Church, fails of his ſalvation, by failing of that which a Chriſtian profeſſeth, as a member of the Church; namely, by forſaking the Unity of the Church. But, a man cannot ſeem to forſake the Unity of the Church, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the integrity of that Chriſtianity, upon which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If the corruption thereof bee ſo great, as may ſeem to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the communion thereof ineffectual, to the ſalvation of them that uſe it; it will bee Charity to joyn for the reſtoring of it, to ſo good an effect; though a breach ſucceed, by the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe who refuſe to joyn for that purpoſe. Though divers miſtakes bee committed, in a work of ſo great weight and conſequence; the want of Charity will lye on that ſide, which ſhall refuſe that reaſon, which, had it condeſcended to, thoſe miſtakes might have been redreſſed. How much more, when there is no other choice left, but, either to continue at the diſtance under which wee were borne; or, to give our ſelves up to the will of thoſe, who, not having given ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>faction in the truſt which they undertake, condeſcend to no terms of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance for the future?</p>
               <p>And truly, though the ſin of Schiſme hinder ſalvation more<note place="margin">What Schiſme deſtroyeth the ſalvation of what perſons, by instances, of the moſt notable Schiſmes.</note> then any other ſin; becauſe it involveth the body of the Church, and ſo hindreth the ſalvation of more; yet is there no cauſe to think, that all who are involved in the ſtate of Schiſme, are involved in the ſin of it. The leſs cauſe there is for it, the greater breach of charity by it. Therefore, the greater, the more viſible the cauſes are, of that change which occaſions it, the leſs is to bee imputed to them that follow ſuch cauſes; Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to private Chriſtians, when ſuch cauſes are as viſible on the one ſide, as the intereſt of each mans ſalvation is viſible to the contrary on the other ſide. Beſides, I ſaid afore, that Schiſme in the Church is the ſame which Civil War, in the ſtate of the World. Now, though War cannot bee juſt on both ſides, for the heads and cauſes of it; yet, for thoſe that follow their heads, in cauſes too difficult for private perſons to judge, it will bee no guilt of bloud, to follow that authority which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them Viſible. Which if it bee true, as it is evidently reaſonable, there will no queſtion remain, that there may bee ſalvation on both ſides of a Schiſme. The Schiſmes of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians, Montaniſts, Donatiſts, Meletians,</hi> and perhaps divers
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48725:104"/> others, were grounded upon ſuch cauſes, as, the Unity of the Church did no leſs viſibly outweigh, then the conſent thereof to the contrary was viſible. Notwithſtanding, ſo long as the Faith remained intire: (as, it doth not appear, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed, from their beginning, any thing neceſſary for the ſalvation of all, to bee believed) and the Offices of Gods Service were miniſtred by them, according to the Order of the Church; as not differing about any of them; I ſhould bee as loth to condemn all the partizans, as to excuſe the cauſes of them, to or from eternal death. How much more in the Schiſmes of the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> of that at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> between <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> of that between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the cauſe of <hi>Acacius,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps in others; in which there was onely breach of Communion, upon ſome diſcontent, in the governing of maters in the Church; without either difference of Faith, or in the Offices of Gods ſervice. I confeſs, Pope <hi>Gelaſius de vinculo an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>thematis,</hi> in the cauſe of <hi>Acacius,</hi> takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all along, that the want of Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rendred all liable to that curſe, which Chriſtians, by failing of the duty of Chriſtians; either as Chriſtians, or as members of the Church; do incurre, upon the ſentence of the Church. But, hee who admitteth that conſtitution of the Church which I maintain, will not eaſily admit the ſentence of a part, (ſuppoſe all the Weſt engaged in the Act of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) able to damn all the Chriſtians of the Eaſt, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered only to the ſucceſſors of <hi>Acacius;</hi> not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs his miſcarriage, which his ſucceſſors themſelves owned not. Rather is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to anſwer God, for the ſouls that miſcarried, by maintaining the breach open, beyond that which the good of Chriſtendom required. Nay, I cannot condemn the opinion of thoſe, who allow a poſſibility of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Sects of the Neſtorians in the Eaſt, and the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites in the South; notwithſtanding that they ſtand divided from the Church, upon occaſion of the Councils of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which it imbraceth. For, it is poſſible, that they may underſtand the terms of their diſtance in ſuch a ſenſe, as may very well ſtand with the Decrees of thoſe Councils: So that, the difference being occaſioned by perſonal diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; though it were mortal to thoſe who brought it to paſs, yet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48725:104"/> may it not bee ſo to thoſe that know not how to help it; if it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not the want of means neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſalvation otherwiſe. But this is not to ſay, that theſe parties are not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the viſible Unity of Gods Church, by communion in the Offices of his ſervice. Should they profeſs themſelves free from an obligation concerning all Chriſtians, as members of the Church; I would not excuſe thoſe that take upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch breaches, becauſe they know not that which they ſhould know. But thoſe that are only ſufferers in ſuch breaches, I ſhould not exclude from the hope of ſalvation upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; not wanting otherwiſe, that which is neceſſary to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians; which, the diviſions of the Church muſt needs render very difficult for the greateſt part to obtain. This I would ſay much more, of the Schiſme between the Greek and Latine Church; being well aſſured, that there is no ſuch defect in the Faith of the Greek Church, as may warrant the Latine Church to ſentence them for Haereticks. And, as for Schiſme, that the Latine Church; by undertaking more then one part of the Church can undertake, without the conſent of the other, in maters of common concernment; hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand in it; whatſoever the truth bee, of the Diſputes that occaſion it. And therefore, it is much to bee lamented, that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould purſue no other terms, of reuniting thoſe diſtreſſed and perſecuted Churches unto it ſelf, but thoſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſubmiſſion to the dictates thereof, without why or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Not being afraid to raiſe them perſecution by unbelievers, that they may bee neceſſitated to that ſubmiſſion, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their perſecution from their Sovereigns. Seeing then, that we have ſo many inſtances of Schiſmes, which exclude not the hope of ſalvation; eſpecially for thoſe that are ſufferers in them; that is, for private Chriſtians; How far ought wee to bee, from yielding to the unreaſonable demands of the Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; charging the Schiſme upon the Reformation, whereof, the abuſes which they maintain are the onely true cauſe? For, though it was always, and ſtill is a very difficult thing, to ſee the true point of Reſormation, ſo as to bring thoſe, that feel the abuſes, to conſent in it; yet, the abuſes being both viſible and palpable, the faults committed by the miſtaking of it will bee imputable to thoſe, that will condeſcend to no reaſon; as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48725:105"/> well as to thoſe, who proceed to a change, without due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the ground and meaſure of it. And therefore, up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n that account, there can bee no bar to the ſalvation of private Chriſtians, that are no actors, but ſufferers in ſuch breaches; though, the miſunderſtanding of the due ground and meaſure of the difference muſt needs occaſion the Ioſs of infinite ſouls, by hindring them of the means that is truly neceſſary for the ſalvation of Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>This is that which I ſaid afore, that Schiſme, as War, may<note place="margin">Difficulty of ſalvation on both ſides, the Reformation remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſect.</note> bee unjuſt on both ſides; The charge of which injuſtice, as it will lye upon thoſe which are actors in it, and cauſes of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to abate it, and not imploying the ſame to ſo good a purpoſe; ſo, it leaves a poſſibility of ſalvation for both ſides. And that is no more then hath been ſaid, from the beginning of our Reformation, by all that allow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a true Church. But that difficulty of attaining ſalvation on both ſides, which the Schiſme inflameth, will bee imputable to thoſe that maintain the extreams, taking offenſe at the due ground and termes of compoſing it.

For, if they inforce not the due uſe of the Power of the Keys; ſo great a part of the conduct of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſouls to ſalvation; and that it is not to bee inforced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtoring Diſcipline in the Clergy; How ſhall it bee viſible, that a ſimple Papiſt ſins in being a Recuſant? How ſhall hee, that invites him to bee no Recuſant, aſſure him of means of ſalvation viſibly ſufficient? How ſhall the State bee enabled, to inflict upon him the legal penalties of his Recuſancy, upon other crimes? For it is manifeſt, that, from thoſe whom the Civil Law of the Land qualifies for the Cure of ſouls, without any ground of pretenſe, that they do concur to the true intent of the Church, in miniſtring the power of the Keys; there is not the leaſt appearance, for any hope of that help, which the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice profeſſeth. Indeed, alleging on the other ſide, thoſe abuſes in private Penance, that neglect of publick Penance, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alloweth, wee allege a ſufficient reaſon for a change, without the authority of it: And a poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, notwithſtanding a defect in redreſſing the ſame. But this poſſibility will conſiſt in the more then ordinary diligence
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48725:105"/> of private Chriſtians; conſidering the ſnares, which diviſion multiplieth: and labouring to ſupply themſelves in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the publick Order of the Church, provided by God to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them of it, ſaileth of the effect which God intendeth.

In the beginning of Chriſtianity, ſome ſins were queſtionable, in ſome parts of the Church, whether curable by the Keys of the Church, or not. The Schiſme of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> pretended, for the ground of it, the re-admitting of Apoſtates: As that of <hi>Montanus,</hi> in part, the re-admitting of Adulterers. But, before all were come to agreement in it, the ſame ſeverity had been practiſed in the Church, without Schiſme. They leſt ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to Gods mercy: They engaged not the Church in warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them pardon. The Council of <hi>Nicaea</hi> ſeems to have put an end to all difformity in the caſe. There is no mention of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt, upon the bed of death, after that. But, ſuppoſing publick ſinners admitted to publick Penance; thereby to give proof of the ſincerity of their repentance: And binding them over to the remainder of their Penance, eſcaping death. Some Canons go ſo low, as to releaſe ſin, without revealing it, upon condition of undergoing the Penance it ſhall require, being revealed, in caſe hee ſurvive. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> chargeth all Prieſts of abſolve all at the point of death, which it alloweth not all to do otherwiſe. As for the Reſervation of Penance; they who require Penance, not to qualifie for pardon, but to ſatisfie the debt of temporal pain, that remains after pardon, I ſuppoſe doe, upon that account, turn it over to Purgatory. But they, from whom, as I ſaid afore, there is no appearance for any hope of that help, which the Keys of the Church, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred according to the Order of the Church, do hold forth; what can wee expect of them, towards the preparing of him that lies on the bed of ſickneſs, for his paſſage? For, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which all pretend to give in that eſtate, may bee imagined to conſiſt in aſſuring ſalvation, to all that once were aſſured of it; to all that think themſelves ſure of it, by believing it, not

Certainly, it is no good ſign in this Caſe, that our people are ſo willing to have the Miniſter pray by them; but ſo unwilling to hear of the Communion, becauſe they know it requires them to take account of themſelves. Nay it is oddes, that it is condeſcended to, at the warning of the Curate; who muſt needs let ſlip the anthority of his Office; in requiring account of him that expects comfort from him; by offering all that hee is able to give, before the account is tendered.

For, the means to bee imployed will conſiſt in a juſt and full debate of reaſon, upon principles agreed upon between the parties, tending to reduce them unto agreement, in ſuch things as remain in difference. This debate may well ſeem dangerous to peace, not ſuppoſing any authority to govern it, within the due bounds, and to direct it unto the due purpoſe. But ſuppoſing, as wee muſt needs ſuppoſe, all parties liable to that authority, which the Law of the Land authorizes; becauſe that is acknowledged, by all parties; neither can the Secular Power allow thſoe, whom it owns for Governors of the Church, leſs, then to govern and direct all diſpute, tending to ſatisfie all that queſtion the Eccleſiaſtical Law of the Kingdom: Nor need they deſire more, for a reaſonable ground of hope for good ſucceſs. There can bee no ground to expect, that they who openly profeſs, the Laws of Religion to bee the ſins of them that make them, can think their duties diſcharged to God, by being inſtrumental, in the executing of them, to the intent to them that make them. They muſt needs think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in conſcience, to deprave, and to pervert the effect of them, to their own intent, in an infinity of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which no diligence of Government can prevent or meet with. But when, upon full and juſt debate it ſhall appear, that a change is refuſed them, meerly becauſe they can ſhew no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for it, upon thoſe grounds, which the common Chriſtianity obliges the parties to acknowledge; condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that they can ſhew ſuch reaſon for; how can it bee imagined, that any prejudice or engagement, that may bee ſo honourably quitted, will prevail above God and their Country, to a defiance of them that <hi>carry not the Sword in vain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conſeſs, I can hope for no good end of any ſuch Diſpute,<note place="margin">The ground of reſolution, the being of the Catholick Church, the firſt and chief point of the debate.</note> without ſuppoſing that ſenſe of the Article, concerning <hi>one Catholick Church,</hi> which hath carried me through this diſcourſe, for the Principle, upon which, all mater in debate is to bee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor can I take it for a ſuppoſition, which they do admit
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48725:107"/> of themſelves. But I ſuppoſe firſt, that, the miſunderſtanding of that which it demandeth being once cleared, the truth of it will bee ſo evident; by that reaſon which muſt ſatisfie for the truth of the common Chriſtianity; that all ſhall bee convinced of it, by that which they allege for themſelves; as being the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their own allegations. Then I ſuppoſe further, that it is the firſt point to bee tried, as that which, in effect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more then half the trial of all the reſt; Which, had it been agreed upon, might have prevented all breaches: And without agreeing upon it, leaves all Diſpute in Religion end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and without hope of conviction, or ſatisfaction, on this ſide or on that. It is not, indeed, to bee expected, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants will ever become a party to ſuch an action; though no way concerned in conſcience, not to own thoſe whom their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign appointeth, for Governors of ſuch a debate. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there would bee any appearance, that thereby they ſhould own them for their Superiors: But becauſe wee find them not diſpoſed to own the obligation of their Chriſtianity; requiring them to concur to it, upon thoſe terms; to bee more antient, then any obligation of their ſpiritual Superiors to the contrary. For, if the Unity of the Church take place before the authority of any Superiors; provided for the maintenance of it; then is every Chriſtian obliged to the due ground and terms of it, before the authority of Superiors. And therefore cannot refuſe them, tendered by a part; though refuſed by a greater part. And therefore cannot refuſe that trial; which is the due means to bring them to light; though his Superiors refuſe it. And therefore, their refuſal can bee no bar to the effect of the action, once grounded upon a ſuppoſition, inforcing the trial, by the Scriptures, expounded by the conſent of the Church; That is, within thoſe bounds, wherein, the agreement thereof may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. For, the ſetling of thoſe terms, upon which, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks are either to bee diſowned by the Presbyterians, or own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Church; As it muſt proceed upon that ſuppoſition, ſo it will render their Recuſancy, as concerning all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that iſſue, viſibly puniſhable, in thoſe that refuſe to give or take ſatisfaction upon ſo juſt terms. And the conſequence of the ſame ſuppoſition, in bounding that which is queſtionable in the Laws of this Church, to the juſtifying of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48725:108"/> which it pretendeth, will leave it without excuſe in other maters. For, the bounds of that diſtance which wee are to hold with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being the ſubject of diſtance among our ſelves; As it is not poſſible to determine them, but upon that ſuppoſition: So, they will oblige all Chriſtians to that penalty, which the Laws of a Chriſtian Kingdom are able to inflict upon thoſe that diſobey them, being made by virtue of the common Chriſtianity. As for my ſelf, it ſhall bee a great pleaſure to me, to compromiſe all that I have ſaid, either of the Faith or Laws of the Church, to the iſſue of ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. For, there is no reaſon, why I ſhould think it a diſparag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my age, not to have ſeen the due conſequence of ſuch a principle, in ſo many maters of ſo doubtful diſpute, better then, ſuch a number of Divines or either ſide, as muſt bee imployed in ſuch a debate, can make it to appear, to thoſe, whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt conduct and govern it.

The ſame will ſerve to difference the liberty which I uſe, in publiſhing this, from the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who band themſelves againſt the Lawes of their Country; they are ſure; without thoſe terms for ſubmiſſion to them, upon which, themſelves cannot deny, that they ſhall bee the Laws of Gods Church in it. Eſpecially, ſeeing I compromiſe as many hours of ſtudy, as much follicitude of thought, as due a courſe of inquiry, into the grounds of the mater in queſtion, as the moſt of my quality can have imployed to the like purpoſe, ſince the beginning of our troubles. And, ſeeing this liberty muſt bee my plea at the great judgment of God, for any thing, wherein I may have miniſtred mine Office, according to that meaſure, which thoſe Laws will inforce, in which, the beſt of my own private judgement requires an amendment.<note place="margin">The conſequence of the ſame, in Uniting the Reformed Churches.</note>

               <p>And the acknowledgement of this Principle puts an end to another motion, concerning the uniting of all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> of all that are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48725:108"/> whether this trial propoſed come to an iſſue or not. For it is manifeſt, that, before the iſſue of ſuch a trial; with them, as among our ſelves; all union with them, upon account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is but mutual toleration, providing that no breach ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; or, that none bee made wider then preſently it is, by the diſclaiming of Communion between the parties. And that is to bee referred to the wiſdom of Superiors; the terms which wee our ſelves ought to inſiſt upon being ſecured, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs profeſſion of that Principle, whereof they are all but the conſequences. Wee are to ſtand to <hi>Luthers</hi> appeal to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that ſhould judge by the Scriptures alone; limiting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scriptures, as the Rule to judge by, to the conſent of the Church, as the evidence for the bounds of it. Had this limitation been expreſſed in their proceedings at home; (as it cannot bee ſaid, ever to have been diſclaimed) in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings abroad with <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> there had been ſufficient ground for preventing, not only the particular breach between them, but the general breach with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> There had been no cauſe, why both parties, of <hi>Reformed and Catholick,</hi> might not have continued one Church, <hi>both Reformed and Catholick.</hi> Since ſo great diſtances are come to paſs; As it is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an union, without agreeing firſt upon the Principle of it: So it will not bee ſafe to maintain Communion, upon toleration of differences on foot, without proteſtation for that Principle, which muſt maintain our own Chriſtianity; leaving them to themſelves and to God, in all maters of difference. If this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion bee demanded, upon the account of common defenſe, againſt the Powers which own the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which ſeems to bee the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, the maters in difference being acknowledged, by ſecuring the principle upon which they are to bee decided; It will always be in their power, to joyn for the maintenance of thoſe Laws, whereby the Reformation is ſetled in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Sovereignties; Without undertaking for the juſtice of any Laws, but thoſe, which each Sovereignty is to anſwer for, becauſe it makes them. And the effect of this reſervation will
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48725:109"/> bee of great conſequence, to the retaining of that Chriſtianity which is left us. For this limitation will exclude all Power of joyning, for the maintenance of Subjects in attempting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, or the maintenance of the ſame, by force, againſt the Will of their Sovereigns. The overſight of which proviſion, in actions of State; imputed to the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion, when they might as well have been intitled to cauſes of Civil Right; hath had a very viſible hand in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which we have ſeen: And is the more carefully to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided for the future, becauſe the pretenſe is, upon all occaſions, ſo ſtudiouſly advanced, by thoſe that have been active in the ſame.</p>
               <p>I have maintained the lawfulneſs of having Images in<note place="margin">An inſtance in the having of Images in Churches.</note> Churches. Now, conſidering the diſtance between <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary;</hi> I find it not amiſs to declare, by this inſtance, upon what terms, the Rule which I have propoſed; of reducing all cuſtoms of this Church to that eſtate, in which wee find them practiſed, during the primitive times of the Catholick Church; may bee ſerviceable to the purpoſe of Unity amongſt our ſelves. For, there is ſo little mention of Images in Churches, during neer four hundred years after Chriſt; for increaſe of devotion, for inſtruction of the unlearned, or for the ornament of Churches; that it may well bee demanded, as for the conſequence of that Rule, that the uſe of them, though lawful, may bee ſurceaſed in Churches. And accordingly, I do acknowledge, that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the benefit reaſonably to bee expected from the uſe of them, with the abuſe, to which, experience hath diſcovered them to bee ſubject; I ſee no cauſe why, the uſe of them might not bee forborn; upon ſuch a reaſon, as might bee effectual to unite us in a Rule bounding the Reformation which wee profeſs, upon the ground of the common Chriſtianity, in all particulars. The reaſon is, becauſe the having of them is not a neceſſary mean to that inſtruction or devotion, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the end of them; and on the other ſide, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all the Reformation, to have been the occaſion of abuſe; the preventing whereof will require that care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which the forbearing of them will ſpare. But, ſeeing it hath appeared no breach upon Chriſtianity, to have them in Churches: and, that the abuſe which may reaſonably bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, by having them to the purpoſes ſpecified, is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48725:109"/> in compariſon with that benefit, which the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unity of the Church procureth; It will never bee lawful to enjoyn this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, without declaring, that it ſignifieth not, that they are held <hi>unlawful:</hi> Or, that wee hold our ſelves bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Unity with the Church, rather then indure them. For, ſeeing the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do uſe them in a great meaſure, for the reaſons ſpecified; If the uniting of us with the reſt of the Reformation, upon the due ground and terms hitherto requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould depend upon a reaſonable compliance, in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it is manifeſt, that it would bee a ſufficient reaſon, to oblige us to the ſame. And therefore much more, if a general re-union with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould come to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a compliance. The conſequence of this inſtance may bee the means, to inform thoſe that are capable, what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Unity may oblige us to abate, of that which wee take to bee for the beſt, in maters of leſs conſequence; that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable benefit of it may bee obtained, in this eſtate, when the protection of Sovereign Powers renders the Unity of the Church ſo neceſſary, ſo effectual, to the ſalvation of all. For, on the other ſide, the interruption of it is that which renders that ſame ſalvation queſtionable; by the difficulty which it createth, of obſerving the duty of a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian; by the impoſſibility rather then the difficulty, which it procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of obſerving the duty of a Chriſtian as a Member of the Church, which, the breach of Unity alloweth not due conduct to underſtand.</p>
               <p>To fortifie the neceſſity of the propoſition that I<note place="margin">An Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> make, I will here propoſe an objection, in behalf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt the validity of our Ordinations; which I have always taken to have weight and difficulty in it, though others do not ſeem to value it. For, the anſwering of this Objection will help to juſtifie the Offenſe to bee taken, and not given, that may come by the liberty which here I uſe. The ſucceſſion of our Biſhops deriveth it ſelf, by Ordination of three Biſhops; which the Canon of the Apoſtles authorizeth; but the Canon of <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi> requireth farther, the conſent of the Biſhops of each Province. Whereby it appeareth, that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by two or three Biſhops is allowed by the Canon of the Apoſtles, upon preſumption, that the Suffragants of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48725:110"/> concur in allowing the Act of their fellows. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ceaſeth in our caſe; Becauſe it is manifeſt, that the greateſt part of the Suffragants did not conſent to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of our Biſhops, but declared againſt it; being therefore diſplaced by the Power of the Sword, deciding for the leſſer part againſt the greater; which the Rule of the Church ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not to do. Whereupon it is argued, that the Secular Power was not able to authorize our Reformation, as Patron of the Church, and the Canons of it. To fortifie the Objection, I allege the caſe of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> who was conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> by three Biſhops; and yet his Conſecration was Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, becauſe againſt <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Conſecrated by ſixteen. So the Ordination of <hi>Majorinus;</hi> that was firſt conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> againſt <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> for a head to the Schiſme of the Donatiſts; was juſtly counted Schiſmatical; though it was made by a number more then ſufficient, of Biſhops duely Ordained. Which, I doubt not, may bee found in other Schiſmes. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the <hi>Novatians</hi> had nothing to charge the Church with, but the readmitting of thoſe that had fallen away in time of perſecution; upon Penance. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> nothing, but, that they who had ordained <hi>Caecilianus</hi> were Apoſtates; Though they were proved to bee otherwiſe, by ſeveral trials, which they would never reſt ſatisfied with. As for all the reſt; though both Sects followed the Faith and the Orders of the Catholick Church, yet they both rebaptized all thoſe whom they reduced to themſelves, from the Communion of it; as counting all the Church Apoſtates, for communicating with thoſe whom they counted Apoſtates. Is this our caſe? do wee find no fault with the Doctrine, or with the Laws of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein Sovereigns might find themſelves bound to right both themſelves, and their Subjects, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſſent of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For, though the Rule of ſucceſſion, by Ordination of Biſhops, bear them not out in it; though the Unity of the Church regularly depend upon the force of that Rule; yet, ſeeing the Unity of the Church fails of the end for which God ordaineth it, unleſs it preſerve the Chriſtianity which it ſuppoſeth, intire, as well in the publick ſervice of God, as in the profeſſion and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians; it ought not to bee taken for a departure from
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48725:110"/> that Unity, that it is reſtored without that authority, which regularly is provided to preſerve it. For, the conſent of all other Eſtates of the Kingdom, in that ground, and upon thoſe terms, which are to take place, before the authority of thoſe that diſſent, will abundantly juſtifie the validity of thoſe Ordinations which declare an intent of miniſtring the Office, according to the due ground and terms which they ſuppoſe. And therefore, it will not bee ſo viſible, when that ground, and thoſe terms are not ſo viſible. And upon theſe terms are the Chriſtian people of this Kingdom bound to own and to authorize them in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; notwithſtanding that the greater part of the Suffragants refuſed them their concurrence to the ſame. And, if the change that is made bee ſuch, in maters of greateſt weight; the caſe will bee the ſame, though it fail of the Rule, in ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of leſs conſequence.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe terms, I admit the plea of the Reformation;<note place="margin">That which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches extendeth not to our Schiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not allowing their miſtake; in thinking the Order of Biſhops the ſupporters of Antichriſt. For it is evident, to him that will uſe his five ſenſes, that the greatneſs of the Pope; for which they will have him to bee Antichriſt; ſtands as well by Uſurping upon the Biſhops, as upon the Crown. And therefore, it was a ſpice of madneſs in our Puritans, to proceed, upon their example, to Ordination, without and againſt their Biſhops, either by Presbyters, or by Congregations. Whereas, they who could not obtain Ordination from Biſhops, becauſe they profeſſed the Reformation, might more juſtly think themſelves tied to proceed; neglecting that which they could not have: But truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mercy of God, that, ſeeing the abuſes of the Church were groſs, and viſible, and palpable; the zeal of Gods Houſe, which carried men to Reforme them, before they were agreed upon all that was to bee reſtored inſtead of them, renders the Reformation, imperfect as it is, effectual to ſalvation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they may have failed in maters of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Eſpecially, conſidering that particular Chriſtians; who are not able to judge of the publick concernments of the Church; may bee able to ſee the abuſes thereof, and to reform their own lives and converſations, by that conduct which an imperfect Reformation may furniſh. Not doubting in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48725:111"/> mean time, that this imperfection is the loſs of an innumerable number of ſouls, as well as the abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are. And therefore, thinking my ſelf tyed to ſay ſo, that all publick perſons, of what quality ſoever, in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in all the ſeveral quarters of Chriſtendom, may bee ſtirred up to conſider, how much it concerns their diſcharge at the day of judgement, that the Reformation bee reduced to that Rule, and that meaſure, in every point, which the ground and reaſon of Reformation evidenceth. For then ſhall wee not need to apprehend any nullity, upon unavoidable neglect of Canonical proceeding; when the reſtoring of Chriſtianity; which all Canons preſuppoſe, and tend to maintain; juſtifieth the defect of it in one, for obtaining the end of it in all acts of the Church.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48725:113"/> to come into Churches that ſhall bee void. But they are to try them by no other Rule, then the Certificate of three <hi>godly</hi> Neighbours, (one at leaſt <hi>a Miniſter</hi>) concerning their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in godlineſs upon their own knowledge: and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of five Commiſſioners, that the Grace of God is in their hearts, and that they are fit to preach. In further proſecution hereof, iſſues forth this Ordinance, whereby, no man is made ſcandalous for his judgement, but hee that is liable to the Act againſt Blaſphemy of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9. 1653. And with him is ranked, hee, who ſhall frequently and publickly have uſed the Service ſince Chriſtmas 1653. Whereby it appeareth, that thoſe who have declared their perſeverance in the Religion which they have hitherto profeſſed, by reading the Service, are therefore counted ſcandalous; But, thoſe that can paſs the trial propoſed, are thereby qualified in Law, to bee Paſtors of Pariſhes: And conſequently, to ſucceed thoſe that adhere to the Chriſtianity which hitherto they have profeſſed; being caſt out, by the Commiſſioners <hi>for ejecting of ſcandalous Miniſters,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, I ſay, that the effect of theſe Laws is, to nullifie, and make void one Article of the Creed, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto wee profeſs; To wit, the belief <hi>of one holy Catholick and Apoſtolick Church.</hi> This word <hi>Church</hi> may ſignifie two things. Firſt, onely the whole number of Chriſtians; Secondly, a <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Corporation</hi> of thoſe that profeſs <hi>true Chriſtianity,</hi> founded by the will of God, and the miniſtery of our Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles. That Chriſtians, when they profeſs to believe <hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> do not mean the firſt ſenſe; that there is in the world a number of men that profeſs to bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; it is manifeſt, becauſe all Chriſtians hope to bee ſaved by their Faith; but they cannot hope to bee ſaved, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which they ſee. Now all men ſee, that there is ſuch a company of men in the world. Therefore, when they ſay, they <hi>believe the Catholick Church;</hi> as part of that Faith, whereby they hope to bee ſaved; they do not profeſs to believe that there is ſuch a company of men; but, that there is a Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true Chriſtians, excluding Haereticks and Schiſmaticks: and, that they hope to bee ſaved by this Faith, as being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. And this is that, which the ſtile of the <hi>holy Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Apoſtolick Church</hi> ſignifies; as diſtinguiſhing the Body of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48725:113"/> true Chriſtians, (to wit, ſo far as profeſſion goes) from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles of Haereticks and Schiſmaticks. For, this title of <hi>Catholick</hi> would ſignifie nothing, if Haereticks and Schiſmaticks were not barred the Communion of the Church. And let no man imagine, that the Schiſme, which the Reformation hath made between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath diſſolved the obligation of being members of the Church. If that change, which is called <hi>Reformation,</hi> preſerve not ſuch a Church, as ought to bee acknowledged for a true member of the whole (or <hi>Catholick</hi>) Church, it is no Reformation, but the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſtianity. Now, when theſe Laws inable Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and Juſtices of the Peace, as well as thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Miniſters, to make publick Preachers; as well ſuch as have received no Ordination from the Church, as thoſe that have; It is manifeſt, that all difference between Clergy and People, is by them diſſolved, and made void: And by conſequence, the Corporation of the Church; which grounds and creates all the difference, which hitherto by all Chriſtians hath been received, between theſe two qualities. True it is, that, for the preſent, as well thoſe who have lawful authority to officiate the publick Service of God, by Ordination from the Church, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or maintained in their Benefices, by theſe Laws, as thoſe that have none; Though it bee well enough known, that, thoſe who have ſuch authority, do pretend to act by virtue of it, and not by this Law; further then, as, by ſubmitting to it, they remove that force, which hinders their right, otherwiſe gotten, to take effect. But it is as true, that, ſuppoſing this Law to continue an age, none ſuch can remain. And when none ſuch remains, then there ſhall bee no Church in <hi>England,</hi> but by equivocation of words; if the premiſes bee true. And therefore, thoſe that acknowledge ſuch as have no other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but from this power, for their Paſtors, cannot conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs to <hi>believe one Catholick Church,</hi> nor hope for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by being members of it. For, ſuppoſing for the preſent, though not granting, that the power which makes theſe Laws is from God; yet can it not bee pretended to bee from our Lord Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And therefore, this authority derived from it, cannot bee derived from any act of theirs, conſtituting the Church, and enabling it to give this authority, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48725:114"/> whereof, Chriſtians preſume that they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now, that you may ſee, why the belief of Chriſts Church is an Article of our Creed; I ſay further, that you cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg ſuch men for your Paſtors, becauſe you are not ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe Laws, that they are not Haereticks. For, ſeeing the Act of Eſtabliſhment pretends only to <hi>hold forth the Chriſtian Religion centained in the Scriptures;</hi> and, that all the Haerefies that are this day in the world do maintain themſelves to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion contained in the Scriptures; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that theſe Laws provide not, that they ſhall not bee Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, which are ſent you for Paſtors. Here, I muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that, whereas all that profeſs <hi>Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though differing from the profeſſion held forth, are protected in the exerciſe of their Religion, Popery and Praelacy are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though it cannot bee denied, that both profeſs <hi>Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nor, that thoſe, who hold the profeſſion eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Laws under which wee were born, are refuſed that protection, which is tendred Socinians, enemies of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Satisfaction of Chriſt; who manifeſtly profeſs <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion contained in the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For, my buſineſs is not to ſay, what they that made theſe Laws ſhould have done, inſtead of making them; but, what you are to do now they are made. But, if it bee anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, thoſe that make theſe Laws, repoſe truſt in them to whom they grant theſe Commiſſions, that they will not take any to bee <hi>godly men</hi> that are Haereticks; To this I ſay, that will not ſerve your turn, for ſeveral reaſons. For, thoſe that profeſs all that this law requires them to profeſs; that is, <hi>Faith in God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion contained in the Scriptures;</hi> cannot bee judged ungodly for whatſoever they profeſs beſides, by any power derived from this Law, but an arbitrary power, to bee exerciſed at the will of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. And, how are you aſſured that no Haeretick ſhall obtain a certificate of three Neighbours, and ſo anſwer their demands, that they ſhall think him in Gods grace? However, you are not warranted to truſt your ſalvation, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that depend on you, either upon the judgement of theſe Commiſſioners, or of them that make the Laws. If it be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48725:114"/> demanded, why the Secular Power, and the Commiſſioners thereof are not as well to bee truſted with the ſalvation of the people, as thoſe that may pretend authority from the Church? the anſwer is ready: That, when you acknowledge a Paſtor ſent by the Church, you neither truſt his perſon, nor the perſon of him that ſends him; but the Laws which the Church hath received from our Lord and his Apoſtles. For, limiting his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and undertaking to exerciſe the function which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth according to them, hee b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>comes thereby qualified for his charge. But hee who acknowledges no ſuch Laws, becauſe hee acknowledges no Catholick Church, deſtroys the truſt you are to have in thoſe whom you acknowledge your Paſtors, that they are not Haereticks.</p>
            <p>And here, I muſt not fail to give you notice, that thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Independents, who, having departed from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon pretenſe of erecting Presbyteries and Congregations, do now make themſelves Commiſſioners to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute theſe Laws, which deſtroy both Presbyteries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; have thereby deſtroyed the ground of all truſt which the Church might have had in them, for conduct in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. For, what profeſſion can it bee preſumed that they will ſtand to, when they ſtand not to that, for which they have deſtroyed the Unity of this Church? which is the reaſon, why Haereticks and Schiſmaticks, though they may bee re-admitted to the Communion of the Church, upon repentance; yet, by the Rules of the Catholick Church, cannot bee re-admitted to bee of the Clergy. For theſe Apoſtaſies make them uncapable of that truſt, which the Church muſt neceſſarily repoſe in the Clergy.</p>
            <p>That you may ſee this is not for nothing; I ſay further, that that there is among us a damnable Haereſie of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> or Enthuſiaſts; formerly, when Puritans were not divided from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> known by the name of <hi>Grindletons</hi> and <hi>Etoniſts.</hi> Theſe do believe ſo to bee ſaved by the free Grace of God, by which Chriſt died for the Elect, that, true faith is nothing but the revelation hereof: and by conſequence, that all their ſins, paſt, preſent, and to come, being remitted by this Grace; to repent of ſin, or to contend againſt it, is the renouncing of Gods free grace, and ſaving faith.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:48725:115"/>
            <p>Another opinion there is, which, I cannot ſay the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold, or require to bee held; but, in regard their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, and Catechiſme diſclaimes it not, and therefore allows them that hold it to bee of their Faction, may well bee ſaid to maintain it; That, for a man to believe that hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to life, and that Chriſt died for him, is that faith, which alone juſtifieth a Chriſtian. Whether of theſe opinions is the better, or the worſe; or, what is the difference between them, let the parties diſpute. This I ſay, that, allowing the merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt to the Elect for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and a title to everlaſting life, in no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of their perſons; it is more reaſonable to ſay, that they can never become guilty of ſin, then, that the remiſſion of their ſins, and their right to life, ſhould depend upon the knowledge of their predeſtination revealed by Faith. For, nothing is true becauſe it is believed, but believed becauſe it is true. And therefore, I ſay, that both of theſe opinions are deſtructive to that foundation of faith, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when, in the Office of Baptiſme, and the beginning of the Catechiſme, it requireth all that are baptized, not only to profeſs the Faith of Chriſt, <hi>but to renounce the fleſh, the world, and the devil, and to fight with them till death, for the keeping of Gods Commandments; aſſuring them hereupon, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and adopted Gods children by his Grace in Chriſt.</hi> For, hee that is ſaved by undertaking and perſevering in this, cannot bee ſaved by believing, that hee is abſolutely predeſtinate to life without it. For, I muſt ſay, that it is one thing to bee abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely predeſtinate to life; another thing to bee predeſtinate to life, by being abſolutely predeſtinate to perſevere till death. For, hee that is predeſtinate to life, by being abſolutely prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to perſevere in the Covenant of Grace till death, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to life in conſideration of the Covenant of Grace, in which hee is predeſtinate to perſevere. And, whether a man can bee abſolutely predeſtinate to preſevere in it, of his own free choiſe, or not; is that which remains in diſpute among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which, I ſuppoſe not here, to bee either true or falſe. But to ſay, that a man is abſolutely predeſtinate to life; and to ſay, that hee is predeſtinate to life, in conſideration of the Covenant of Grace; which muſt bee the act of his own free
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48725:115"/> choice; is to ſay expreſs contradictions: And to ſay, that a man is predeſtinate to life without conſideration of the Covenant of Grace, is to deſtroy the Covenant of Grace, and the hope of ſalvation; which is meerly imaginary, if not grounded upon it. Seeing then, that the trial upon which theſe Commiſſioners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, is, their marks of predeſtination, whether they bee true or falſe; not ſuppoſing the Covenant of Grace, the undertaking of it, and perſevering in it; I ſay, that you are no way ſecured by theſe Laws, that the Triers themſelves, much leſs thoſe whom they ſhall ſend you, are not complices of this damnable Haereſie.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget to adviſe you, that <hi>Dell;</hi> one ſo far of this Haereſie, that he is thought to have written the Book called the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſmes,</hi> againſt Baptiſme it ſelf: is now, and is acknowledged by theſe Commiſſioners, Maſter of a Colledge in the Univerſity; (whereof ſeveral fellows have been notorious Preachers of this Haereſie) who cannot bee acknowledged a member of the Church by any good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The like I allege in regard of the Sect of the Anabaptiſts. In which point, I muſt ſuppoſe two things. Firſt, that the Chriſtian Faith ſuppoſeth Original ſin. Secondly, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſme, there is no cure for it. And this depends upon the premiſes; that there is no abſolute predeſtination, without conſideration of the Covenant of Grace; which Baptiſme exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, cureth it. For, whatſoever our Lord meant, when hee ſaid; <hi>unleſs ye bee born again of water</hi>—it is manifeſt, that, though no man can become a true Chriſtian, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the operation of the Holy Ghoſt; yet, the habitual gift and indowment of the Holy Ghoſt, dwelling in a man, is not granted, but in conſideration of his entring into the ſaid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that this gift is the only cure of Original ſin. There is then no neceſſity of ſhewing an expreſs precept in Scripture, that all Infants bee baptized: or, that the Church from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time did Baptize all, while they were Infants. If the Chriſtian Faith ſuppoſe Original ſin, if no cure for that, but by the Covenant of Grace, if no execution of that Covenant, but the Baptiſme of the Church; (unleſs, where the outward act is prevented by inevitable neceſſity, after the inward deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſufficiently reſolved and declared) then is this neceſſity a conſtraining precept, and hath been ſo reputed by the Church,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48725:116"/> ever ſince the Apoſtles; Which always hath taken order, not that all ſhould bee baptized Infants, but that no Infant ſhould die unbaptized. For, the diligent watch over all occaſions, that might carry Infants out of the world unbaptized, obſerved by the Church from the beginning, though neglected ſince; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth, no legal aſſurance of the ſalvation of ſuch as ſhould die unbaptized; Whatſoever might bee preſumed of Gods goodneſs, over and above what hee declareth. But, as for thoſe that ſhall become obliged and engaged to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, by being conſecrated to God through the act of the Church, thereby obliging it ſelf to ſhew them the truth of Chriſtianity, which obligeth all to whom it is ſhewed; the neceſſity aforeſaid, together with the practiſe of the Church, is a legal preſumption, of the cure of Original ſin, and the opening of Paradiſe, which it only ſhutteth. If therefore our Anabaptiſts do not believe Original ſin, they are Pelagian Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. If, believing it, they believe notwithſtanding, that it is cured by Predeſtination, without the Covenant of Grace, they fall into the Haereſie premiſed. And, voiding the Baptiſme which they received of the Church, they ſeem to renounce the Chriſtianity which it inacteth; but manifeſtly they render their own Baptiſme void of effect towards God. For, they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize upon a ground, that allows Salvation by Gods Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation revealed by Faith, without undertaking and perſevering in the Covenant of Grace, cannot pretend to baptize into the Covenant of Grace; that is, into the profeſſion of the true Faith, and, of fighting againſt ſin until death, under the ſame. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, that the neceſſity of Baptiſme cannot bee denied, but upon ſuch a ground, as voideth the Covenant of Grace; and ſeeing the Triers are either Anabaptiſts themſelves, or complices in the ſame Commiſſion with Anabaptiſts; (whereof there are divers in theſe Commiſſions) it is evident, that, by theſe Laws, you are no ways ſecured of having Anabaptiſts for your Paſtors; who are expreſsly Schiſmaticks, (forſaking the Church for that which the Church always did,) and, by conſequence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reaſons, Haereticks.</p>
            <p>As the Baptiſme of thoſe men, whom they pretend to ſend you for Paſtors, is, by this reaſon, void of effect; So, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt which they may pretend to celebrate, will bee void of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48725:116"/> the effect of a Sacrament toward you, but not void of the crime of Sacrilege towards God. The reaſons are two. The firſt, becauſe, thoſe who have not received the Order of Prieſthood ſhall pretend to celebrate it. For, the Scripture, interpreted by the un-interrupted practice of the Church, allows no man, under the Order of a Prieſt, to celebrate the Euchariſt. Not, as if thoſe who call themſelves <hi>Miniſters</hi> did commit this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in conſecrating the Euchariſt. For, though the name of <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſignifies no more then <hi>Deacons;</hi> and, that it is truly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for <hi>Deacons</hi> to celebrate the Euchariſt; Yet, they whom they call <hi>Miniſters,</hi> if Ordained, were Ordained Prieſts; with power to celebrate the Euchariſt. For, they call them <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to impoſe upon the World an opinion, which they cannot prove by the Scripture; That they are the only <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments.</hi> The ſecond, becauſe they know not, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, the Conſecration, that is requiſite to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and being of this Sacrament, by the ſame Scriptures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the un-interrupted cuſtome and practice of the Church. For, the whole Church of God, allowing the elements conſecrated to bee the Body and Bloud of Chriſt myſtically, or in the Sacrament; alloweth this change to bee made by the conſecration, before which they were only Bread and Wine. Not as if, after the Conſecration, they were not ſo; but becauſe they are then become that which they were not afore: to wit, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Chriſts Body and Bloud; or, the Body and Bloud of Chriſt <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> and <hi>myſtically;</hi> that is, <hi>in the Sacrament.</hi> This Conſecration being exactly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> they that preſume to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Euchariſt, without acknowledging the ſame: and, pretending to deſtroy the Law by which it is exerciſed; muſt bee preſumed, not to acknowledge the neceſſity thereof, to the being of this Sacrament: And therefore, they, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices in the Communion thereof, to bee guilty of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; as not diſtinguiſhing a ſign of mans inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from a Sacrament of Gods appointment and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>As for the Office of Preaching and Praying, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, in behalf of the Church; I will mark you out two monſtrous Impoſtures, in all the Sects of this time. The firſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48725:117"/> is this ground of the now pretended Reformation of Religion in <hi>England;</hi> That the Church is not to aſſemble for the Service of God, but when there is Preaching. This ſeems to ſtand upon a very groſs miſtake, of thoſe paſſages of the Apoſtles writings, which declare, the neceſſary means of ſalvation to conſiſt, in hearing the Goſpel preached; As if they were meant of Sermons in the Pulpit, which are onely made to thoſe that are already Chriſtians; not of publiſhing the Goſpel to thoſe that knew it not afore, convincing them that it is true, and inſtructing them wherein it conſiſts. Or, as if thoſe that are already Chriſtians wanted any thing neceſſary to ſalvation; ſuppoſing them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the Chriſtianity which they have profeſſed. Not as if their Chriſtianity did not oblige them to hear Sermons, when the authority of the Church aſſures them to bee without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe; But becauſe, the Offices of publick Prayers, and the Praiſes of God, eſpecially in celebrating the bleſſed Euchariſt, are the end of all that inſtruction in Chriſtianity, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians receive from the Church; and therefore, all Preaching ſubordinate to the ſame, as the means to the End. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they may bee daily ſo frequented, without offenſe, and to the increaſe of the reverence due to Chriſtianity; as, the experience of our time ſhows, that Preaching cannot bee.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that the firſt day of the week, called Sunday, is the Sabbath, by force of the fourth Commandment. A miſtake ſo groſs, that it may well ſerve for an inſtance, what Faction can do, with men that are ſober otherwiſe. That God, by commanding the Jews to keep the ſeventh day of the week; to wit, that day on which hee ended the Creation of the world; and, for that very reaſon commanding it, ſhould bee thought to command Chriſtians to keep the firſt day of the week, on which hee began the Creation, and our Lord Chriſt aroſe from the dead; That is, that the ſame words of the ſame Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in writing, ſhould oblige Jews to reſt on the Saturday, which oblige Chriſtians to reſt on the Sunday; is a thing, which, when this fit of frenzie ſhall bee paſt us, will ſcarſe bee believed, that ever any man would believe. True it is, this firſt day hath been obſerved, in, and ever ſince the Apoſtles time; but, not by virtue of that Law, which, their Office was to declare expired, and out of date; but, by the Act of their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48725:117"/> own authority, whereby they gave Laws to Chriſts Church.</p>
            <p>Let us now only compare the daily morning and evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Prayer and the Praiſes of God, eſtabliſhed by the Order of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> together with the more ſolemn ſervice of Lords days and Feſtivals; with a bare Sermon upon Sundays, uſhered in and out with a Prayer of every mans own conceit; (ſetting aſide the Haereſie and falſe Doctrine, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Schiſm, the Blaſphemy and Slander, the ridiculous Follies which this Sermon and Prayer may, and which wee have known them contain) I ſay, comparing theſe together, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation pretended, is and ought to bee accounted, <hi>the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of deſolation,</hi> in compariſon of that Order which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth. And therefore, upon this account alone, thoſe who, not being inveſted with that ordinary Power by which the Church is inabled to correct abuſes in the Church, ſhall uſurp the Power of the Church to introduce this diſorder; are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Schiſmaticks themſelves, and thoſe that acknowledge them for their Paſtors, complices of Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>It will bee ſaid, that theſe Laws will bee amended; as it was many times ſaid awhile ſince, that <hi>the Parliament would ſettle a Miniſtery.</hi> To this I ſay, that thoſe who ſhall bee ſent you, by virtue of theſe Laws, have every way as good authority, as any, the Power that made theſe Laws, joyned with a Parliament, can give to them, that are not otherwiſe qualified by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church. That is, that this Power, and the power of a Parliament together; though, adviſing with Divines; can do no more, then this Power, with adviſe of thoſe Divines which it uſeth, hath done. Becauſe both are Secular, and able to make men <hi>their Miniſters,</hi> to maintain the Intereſt of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which their Power conſtituteth; but not <hi>Miniſters of the Church,</hi> to maintain the Intereſt of that Faith, and Service of God, which it is truſted with. If it bee ſaid, that, in moſt parts of the Reformation, thoſe from whom the Miniſtery is propagated, had not received, by their Ordination, Power to ordain others; For anſwer, I ſuppoſe; That the abuſes crept into the Church were ſo great, that particular Churches; that is, part of the whole; might, and ought to reform themſelves, without conſent or concurrence of the whole. I ſuppoſe that, though there bee in the Church a ſucceſſion of perſons, indued
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48725:118"/> with authority in behalf of it; as well as of Faith, and of Rules, or Laws; Yet, the ſucceſſion of perſons is of leſs conſideration; being ſubordinate to the ſucceſſion of Faith and Laws, as the means to the end. And then I ſay; that, ſuppoſing a neceſſity of Ordaining, becauſe they who refuſed the Reformation would not Ordain to that purpoſe; And, ſuppoſing the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee that which God requireth; There is cauſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that the intent, which thoſe that agree in it declare, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, by Gods goodneſs, that nullitie, which the want of Power to Ordain would otherwiſe infer. For, thoſe miſtakes of leſs conſequence, which humane weakneſs muſt needs commit, in a work of ſuch weight; as it were malice in man to juſtifie, ſo, it may well bee thought mercy in God to excuſe. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption there is, that the Churches thus conſtituted are true Churches: And the Offices miniſtred by perſons thus qualified, effectual to convey the Grace of God to Chriſtian people. But wee ſuppoſe, in our caſe, that Presbyterian Ordinations tend no more to the exerciſe of true Chriſtianity, then of that which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hitherto profeſſeth. And wee ſee with our eyes, that the authority that maketh them deſtroyeth it ſelf; by deſtroying the authority of their Biſhops, from whom it claimeth. And therefore, to imagine, that an Aſſembly of Divines, by being lawfully Ordained to the office of Prieſts or Deacons, according to the Laws of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Secular Power, make Ordinations, which, the Laws under which they were Ordained forbid; is to imagine, that God can inable man to ſin; or, that a Sovereign Power can authorize the Subject to rebell againſt it ſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the qualities of perſons, to bee ſent you for Paſtors, may bee otherwiſe limited by Acts which Parliaments may make, yet theſe qualities, (not being derived from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Apoſtles founding the Church, by any act of the Church; but from Secular Power, and Commiſſion iſſued from it) make them no more Miniſters of the Church, that are made by Aſſemblies of Divines and Presbyteries; then thoſe that are made by Commiſſion of Triers, and, for ejecting ſcandalous Miniſters. That is, both of them being by their creation Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; and, their profeſſion not clearing them of miſpriſion of Haereſie; they can no more bee acknowledged by thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48725:118"/> to adhere to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then Belial by Chriſt, or darkneſs by light.</p>
            <p>Hereby then you may conclude, how to receive thoſe, whom the Presbyterians may ſend you for Paſtors, by any change in the Secular Power. For I charge not them, that they do not believe the Church; which they would bee themſelves. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they ſecure you from all Sects but themſelves. But, in as much as they maintain Predeſtination to life, onely in conſideration of what Chriſt hath already done or ſuffered for the Elect; in ſo much, I ſay, that they do not, nor can Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize into the Croſs of Chriſt; that is to ſay, into the hope of Salvation, in conſideration of the Covenant of Baptiſme. For, that which is abſolutely due; as ſalvation is due to the elect by the gift of Gods Predeſtination; cannot bee burthened with any condition of Chriſtianity afterwards. Nor can hee, who is once ſure to bee ſaved, without that condition which Baptiſm inacteth, bee bound to <hi>fight againſt the fleſh, the world and the Devil, for the keeping of Gods Commandments, under the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian Faith;</hi> for the obtaining of that which hee is ſure of before. And therefore their Baptiſme is no effectual Baptiſme before God, if Baptiſme received in the Church of <hi>England</hi> bee ſuch; (that is to ſay, it is no Baptiſme, but by Equivocation of words) in as much as, the obligation of a mans Chriſtianity is not declared, or underſtood, to take hold of him, by virtue of it. For, ſeeing the hope of ſalvation which Chriſtians have by their Baptiſme is grounded upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Chriſtianity; that Baptiſme which promiſeth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without providing for this condition, is no Baptiſme, but by equivocation of words.</p>
            <p>I ſay further, that the change, which they call Reformation, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly tends, to introduce that <hi>monſtrous impoſture</hi> of two Sermons every <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in ſtead of the daily and ordinary ſervice of God; together with the more ſolemn ſervice of God upon Feſtivals and Lords days, and other extraordinary occaſions; which the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (with the whole Church of God from the beginning.) hath maintained, ſo far as there was means to maintain it. I will not here inſiſt upon the order of Biſhops, and their chief power in their Dioceſes, as of Divine Right; that is, inſtituted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the Apoſtles. Let the Presbyterians think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48725:119"/> privileged to erect Altar againſt Altar, upon ſo deſperate a Plea, as now they inſiſt upon; that the Presbyteries are <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of divine right.,</hi> then the chief Power of Biſhops, in their Dioceſes; I inſiſt now only, that this Power of the Biſhops, was not againſt Gods Law: which every man muſt grant me, that acknowledges a Church in <hi>England</hi> from the Reformation till now. In this caſe, they, who, to introduce this Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and this publick exerciſe of it; tranſgreſſing that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to which they were called by the viſible act of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> take upon them, to ſhare that Power from which they had their authority, among themſelves, and, to execute it by conſent among themſelves, in their ſeveral precincts; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaid to conſtitute a Church, by virtue of any act of the Apoſtles, or any authority derived from ſuch act; but by virtue of their own act, as all Apoſtates and uſurpers do. That is to ſay, that, they do not conſtitute ſuch a Church, by being a member whereof, a man may reaſonably aſſure himſelf of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, upon any principle of Chriſtianity; but ſuch a Church, as is indeed no Church, unleſs it bee by equivocation of terms; but a conventicle of Schiſmaticks, with the miſpriſion of the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie aforeſaid. And therefore their Prieſthood is no Prieſthood, their Euchariſt is no Euchariſt; (unleſs it bee by equivocation of words) but Sacrilege againſt Gods Ordinance. Beſides, that, what is requiſite to the conſecration of the Euchariſt, or, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſts, they ſeem to bee as ſecure of, and as little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as the moſt ignorant of thoſe Sects, into which, the once common name of Puritans ſtands divided at this time. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in any Secular Power, though never ſo unqueſtionable, to cure theſe nullities and incapacities, in the pretenſe, upon which they take upon them to bee a Church. Though for the preſent, they are not ſo much as authorized to the world, by any privilege or penalty enacted by any Secular Power; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protected by that which now poſſeſſeth. Whereby the world may ſee, that there is nothing but their own uſurpation, and the conſent of thoſe whom they have debauched to their Schiſme, for them to ſubſiſt by, under the pretenſe of a Church. And, that they will, by virtue of their Original, bee as malignant to any Secular Power, that ſhall not maintain and authorize them, as ever they were to that which they have deſtroyed, to introduce this ſhadow of a Church.</p>

            <p>If it bee objected, that your Eſtates will bee liable to penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that may bee enacted againſt thoſe that withdraw from the exerciſe of the Religion publickly held forth; To this I have no anſwer, but, that wee are to obey God rather then man; to prefer the next world before this; and to bear Chriſts Croſs, if wee expect his kingdom. Only thus much I muſt obſerve; that theſe Laws proceed from a profeſſion, that it is not lawful to force mens Conſciences, in matter of Religion, by penalties. And therefore, though the Praelatical party are not protected in the exerciſe of their Religion; yet cannot they bee puniſhed for it, but by denying that which is declared upon the publick Faith. Beſides, acknowledging <hi>the Chriſtian Religion contained in the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>profeſſing-faith in God, by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they are as much qualified for protection, as thoſe that are protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Act of Eſtabliſhment. And, not to allow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that Religion, the profeſſion whereof is not diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeems to bee, to forbid men to bee Chriſtians, who are not forbidden to bee ſuch Chriſtians; and to expoſe them to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tumult, (contrary to the publick peace) whom no Law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes.

            <p>If you demand, what means I can ſhew you to exerciſe your Religion, withdrawing from the means which theſe Acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide: I anſwer, that there are hitherto, every where, of the Clergie, that adhere to the Church; who will find it their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſee your infants Chriſtned, your children Catechiſed, the Euchariſt communicated to all, that ſhall withdraw from Churches forcibly poſſeſſed by them whom you own not for Paſtors. And if they cannot continually miniſter to you, ſo diſperſed, the ordinary Offices of Gods Service; you have the Service of God according to the Order of the Church, you have the Scriptures to read for part of it, you have ſtore of Sermons manifeſtly allowed by the Church to read, you have

To ſerve God with theſe in private, with ſuch as depend upon you, and are of the ſame judgement with you, (leaving out what belongs to the Prieſts Office to ſay) I do, to the beſt of my judgement, believe an acceptable ſacrifice to God; which you cannot offer at the Church, in ſuch caſe. And though I cenſure not my brethren of the Clergie, that think fit to complie with the power which wee are under, in holding or coming by their Benefices; (I ſuppoſe, in reſpect to their flocks, rather then to their fruits) yet, if they believe themſelves, and their flocks, to bee members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they muſt needs believe, thoſe flocks that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuch Paſtors, to bee members of no Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledge you, and own your departure, and declare themſelves to their own flocks, and inſtruct them to do the like, when the like caſe falls out: And ſo, the refuſing to hear the voice of ſtrangers, will unite us to make a flock, under thoſe whom wee acknowledge our lawful Paſtors.</p>
            <p>I have found my ſelf preſſed, to Print Copies hereof, for mine own uſe, thereby to declare thus much of my judgement to you, and to the reſt of my friends; becauſe the conſequence of owning ſuch men for your Paſtors, will bee, to make us members of ſeveral Churches.

            <head>The due Way of compoſing the differences on Foot, preſerving the Church; According to the Opinion of <hi>HERBERT THORNDIKE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have found my ſelf obliged, by that horrible confuſion in Religion, which the late War had introduced, to declare the utmoſt of mine opinion, concerning the whole point of Religion, upon which the Weſtern Church ſtands divided into ſo many parties. And now, finding no cauſe to repent me of doing it, can find no cauſe why I ſhould not declare the conſequence of it, in ſetling of that which remains of our differences. For, middle waies to ſo good an end, are now acceptable, meerly as middle waies, and tending to drive a bargain, without pretending that they ought to bee admitted. How much more an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent pretending neceſſity, from reaſons extant in publick, and not contradicted?</p>
            <p>The chief ground that I ſuppoſe here, becauſe I have proved it at large, is the meaning of that Article of our Creed, which profeſſeth <hi>one Catholick Church.</hi> For, either it ſignifies nothing, or it ſignifies, that God hath founded one <hi>Viſible</hi> Church; that is, that he hath obliged all Churches, (and all Chriſtians, of whom all Churches conſiſt) to hold viſible communion with the <hi>Whole</hi> Church, in the viſible offices of Gods publick ſervice. And therefore I am ſatisfied, that the differences upon which wee are divided, cannot bee juſtly ſetled upon any terms, which any part of the <hi>Whole</hi> Church ſhall have juſt cauſe to refuſe, as inconſiſtent with the unity of the <hi>Whole</hi> Church. For, in that caſe, wee muſt needs become Schiſmaticks, by ſetling our ſelves upon ſuch Laws, under which any Church may refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with us, becauſe it is bound to communicate with the <hi>Whole</hi> Church. True it is, that the foundation of the Church, upon theſe terms, will preſuppoſe the intire profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, whether concerning Faith or Manners. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how ſhould thoſe Offices, in which all the Church is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48725:121"/> bee counted the ſervice of God, according to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? And this profeſſion is the condition, upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going whereof, all men, by being baptized and made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are alſo admitted to communion with the Church, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it.</p>
            <p>But nothing can make it viſible to the common reaſon of all men, what communion they are to reſort unto for their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the viſible Communion of all parts of the Church; which, having been maintained for divers ages of the Church, is now viſibly interrupted by the Reformation, and before, by the breach between the Greek and Latin Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it bee viſible to reaſon rightly informed, what communion a man is to imbrace for his Salvation; yet it is not now viſible to the common reaſon of all men that ſeek it. If this bee true, then, no power of the Church can extend ſo far, as to make any thing a part of the common Chriſtianity, which was not ſo from the beginning; but it muſt needs extend ſo far, as to limit and determine all maters in difference, ſo as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Unity may require. And therefore, the Unity of all parts ſuppoſing the profeſſion of Chriſtianity whole, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; we ſhall juſtly bee chargeable with the crime of <hi>Haereſie,</hi> if wee admit them to our communion, who openly diſclaim the Faith of the whole Church, or any part of it. For, thoſe are juſtly counted Haereticks, as to the Church, by the Canons of the Church, that communicate with thoſe who profeſs Haereſie; though no Haereticks as to God, not believing it themſelves. But the Unity of all parts being ſubordinate, and of inferiour conſideration to the Unity of the Whole; wee ſhall juſtly bee chargeable with the crime of Schiſme, if wee ſeek Unity within our ſelves, by abrogating the Laws of the Whole, as not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold communion with it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I am convicted, that, as things ſtand, wee are not to expect any reaſon from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe who hold communion with it, in reſtoring the unity of the Church, upon ſuch Laws, as ſhall render the means of Salvation viſible to all that uſe them as they ought. And this, and only this, I hold to bee the due ground; upon which wee are inabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide an eſtabliſhment of Unity in Religion among our ſelves, (as heretofore a Reformation in Religion for our ſelves) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48725:121"/> concurrence of the Whole. But if wee ſhould think our ſelves at large, to conclude our ſelves without reſpect to the Faith and Laws of the whole Church, wee may eaſily bring upon our ſelves a juſt imputation of Haereticks, for communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Haereticks; but a juſter of Schiſmaticks, if wee abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Laws of the whole Church, to obtain Unity among our ſelves; as declaring thereby, that we are not content to hold Unity with the Whole, unleſs a part may give Law to the Whole. So far am I from that madneſs, which hath had a hand in all our miſeries; of thinking the right meaſure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to ſtand in going as far as it is poſſible from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, were it evidenced, (as it neither is, nor ever will bee evidenced,) that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Antichriſt, and all Papiſts, by their profeſſion, Idolaters; yet muſt wee either raſe the Article of <hi>one Catholick Church</hi> out of our Creed, or confeſs, that the <hi>Pope</hi> can neither bee Antichriſt, nor the Papiſts Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for, or by any thing which is common to them with the Whole Church.</p>
            <p>I know ſome will think it ſtrange, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate us on <hi>Maundy-Thurſdays;</hi> that wee ſhould ſwear in the Oath of Supremacy, that no forreign Prelate hath, or ought to have, any Juriſdiction, or Authority Eccleſiaſtical in this Kingdom; and yet wee bee ſubject to do ſuch Acts, for which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may juſtly renounce communion with us. But the word <hi>ought</hi> in that Oath is Indicative, and not Potential; not <hi>deberet,</hi> but <hi>debet.</hi> For it were a contradiction for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to pray for <hi>the Catholick Church,</hi> and the unity thereof, and yet renounce the Juriſdiction of the whole Church, and the General Council thereof, over it ſelf. King <hi>James</hi> of excellent memory, acknowledgeth the <hi>Pope</hi> to bee Patriarch of the <hi>Weſt;</hi> that is, Head of the general Council of the Weſtern Churches. And the right R. Father in God, <hi>Thomas L. B.</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> under Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in his anſwer to the Seminaries Apology, being demanded why wee own him not ſo in effect, anſwereth bluntly, but truly, becauſe hee is not content with the right of a Patriarch. For, ſhould hee diſclaim the pretenſe of diſſolving the bond of Allegiance, ſhould hee retire to the privilege of a Patriarch, in ſeeing the Canons executed, the Schiſme would lie at our door, if wee
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48725:122"/> ſhould refuſe it. Now, if they curſe us, while wee pray for the Unity of the whole Church, is it not the caſe of the Catholicks with the Donatiſts? For, theſe rebaptized them whom thoſe had baptized, whited over the inſide of their Churches, when they became poſſeſſed of them, ſcraped over their Altars, (being Tables of wood) in deteſtation of them, as Apoſtates and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors; while the Catholicks called them <hi>brethren,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them rightly baptized, and received them that were converted from that Schiſm in their reſpective Orders. The Unity of the Church is of ſuch conſequence to the ſalvation of all Chriſtians, that no exceſs on one ſide can cauſe the other to increaſe the diſtance, but they ſhall bee anſwerable for the ſouls that periſh by the means of it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, not departing from the opinion which I have declared, concerning the terms upon which all parties ought to reconcile themſelves, until I ſhall have reaſon ſhowed me, why I ſhould do it; I ſhall now go no further, then the maters that are actually queſtioned among us; not extending my diſcourſe to points, that may perhaps more juſtly become queſtionable, then ſome of thoſe which have come into diſpute. Profeſſing in the beginning, that I believe they may and ought to bee ſetled by a Law of the Kingdom, obliging all parties beſide Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. But, that the mater of that Law ought to bee limited by the conſent and Authority of the Church, reſpective to this Kingdom. And withall, that I think it ought to be held, and ſhall for mine own part hold it an act meerly <hi>ambulatery,</hi> and <hi>proviſional</hi> for the time. For, though there is no hope of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as things are; yet is there infinite reaſon for all ſides, to abate of their particular pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the recovering of ſo incomparable a benefit as the Unity of the Whole; If ever it ſhall pleaſe God to make the parties appear diſpoſed to it.</p>
            <p>Now, the errors which wee are to ſhut out, if wee will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Unity of a Viſible Church, (that is, of Gods Whole Church) are two, in my judgement. Firſt, though ſome things have been diſputed in other parts, from whence the ſame conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may bee inferred; yet <hi>England</hi> is the place, and ours the times, which firſt openly and downright have maintained, that there is no ſuch thing as a Church, in the nature of <hi>one viſible
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48725:122"/> Communion,</hi> founded by God. But it is maintained by ſeveral parties among us, upon ſeveral grounds. For, ſome do not, or will not underſtand, that there can bee any Eccleſiaſtical power founded by that act of God which foundeth Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where there is Secular Power, founded alſo by thoſe acts of God, whereby hee authorizeth and inforceth all juſt Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Though all times, all parts, all Nations of Chriſtendom <hi>ſince Conſtantine,</hi> profeſs to maintain the Church in that power, in which they found it acknowledged by Chriſtians, when hee firſt undertook to maintain that Chriſtianity which hee profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; all this muſt bee taken, either for meer hypocriſie, or meer nonſenſe. Others there are, that do not think themſelves obliged to the unity of Gods Church, upon far different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. There are of our <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> ſuch as are themſelves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a Church to themſelves, and by themſelves; as being above Ordinances, and the Communion of the Church provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for proficients. But all Independent Congregations make the ſame profeſſion, and are manifeſtly grounded upon the ſame. For, how can they imagine themſelves members of <hi>one viſible Church,</hi> who profeſs that they cannot bee obliged to hold communion with any Congregation but their own?</p>
            <p>And yet, with favour, the ſame conſequence inſuing upon ſo different pretenſes, there muſt bee ſome ſuppoſition common to both, upon which both do ground themſelves. And it is eaſily viſible what that is. Both opinions muſt ſuppoſe, that a man may bee heir to Chriſts Kingdom, and indowed with Gods Spirit, without being, or before hee bee a member of Gods Church. And the Independents indeed do manifeſtly profeſs, that, knowing themſelves and others to bee Gods children, and indowed with his Spirit, they are in a capacity to joyn in Eccleſiaſtical Communion, with thoſe whom they know to bee ſuch. So, they become members of a Church, being Gods children before, without conſidering how they ſhall bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Whole Church. The others are ſatisfied, that, by being members of a State which profeſſeth Chriſtianity, they are alſo members of that <hi>one Holy Catholick and Apoſtolick Church,</hi> which by our Creed wee profeſs to believe. A ground which holdeth accidentally, ſo long as that State conſtituteth a viſible member of the Whole, or the Catholick Church.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48725:123"/> But not imaginable to ſerve the turn, when States differ in point of Chriſtianity, and may every day appeal to force, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the true Church and whether the falſe.</p>
            <p>For, is it not manifeſt, that the profeſſions of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> the Greeks, the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> are protected by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign powers, as well as the profeſſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Is it not manifeſt, that the Powers that profeſs them, maintain them reſpectively to bee Gods truth? Why then do wee diſpute any longer, which is the true Religion and which is the falſe, if it bee enough for Chriſtians to reſolve all the doubt they can have concerning Religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the command of their Sovereigne, only profeſſing Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Is it not manifeſt that Sovereigns do uſe to puniſh their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that conform not to their Laws concerning Religion, but follow that Religion which is in force under other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties? Is it poſſible to imagine, that Subjects can bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, by one and the ſame will of God, to follow contrary Religions under ſeveral Sovereigns? Or that Sovereigns can bee inabled, by one and the ſame Law of God, to puniſh their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for ſerving God according to contrarie profeſſions? True it is, Subjects that ſuffer in a good cauſe ſhall bee gainers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; gaining Heaven by their loſſes of this world. But what ſhall become of the Sovereigns that perſecute them, being in a good cauſe? Or how ſhall not ſome of them bee perſecuted in a good cauſe, who are perſecuted in contrary cauſes? I know not whether this peremptory difficulty was the cauſe; But I am ſure recourſe hath been had to a more deſperate anſwer; that every Subject is bound to profeſs the Religion of his Sovereign; yea, though it in join him to renounce Chriſt with his mouth; remaining bound all the while to believe in him with his heart: and that by this belief, hee ſhall bee ſaved as a Chriſtian. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this poſition tenable but upon this anſwer; nor doth this anſwer import any leſs, then the utter renouncing of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I know, that in the Records of the antient Church, thoſe who only profeſſed to believe Chriſtianity, (who were called <hi>Catecbumeni,</hi> or <hi>Scholars to the Church</hi>) are ſometimes called by the name of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But I know withall, that they were never counted in the ſtate of Salvation, till they had taken upon them the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, by being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imtted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48725:123"/> to the Sacrament of Baptiſme. I know alſo, that this Baptiſme, though it was not counted void, when it was Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in due form; yet it was never counted effectual to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but when a man is baptized into the true Faith; and that, in the Unity of Gods Church. For, though the names of Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schiſmaticks, have been made only <hi>Bug-bears</hi> to fright children with, in this time of our troubles; yet, ſo long as Chriſtianity continues, thoſe that ſeparate themſelves from the Church upon pretenſes concerning the ſubſtance of Faith, ſhall bee properly counted <hi>Haereticks;</hi> But, if the cauſe concern not the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> And therefore, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity conſiſting not only in believing, or purpoſing with the heart, but alſo in profeſſing with the mouth; (firſt ſincerelie, then the true Faith, and laſtly, by being baptized) hee that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf free to renounce his Chriſtianity, as far as the mouth, hath effectively renounced it; becauſe hee hath effectively drawn back that promiſe, upon condition whereof hee was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; of profeſſing Chriſtianity to the death.</p>
            <p>And truly, if every Chriſtian State bee the Church of God within the territories thereof, then cannot all Churches concur to make up that one Viſible Church of God which our Creed profeſſeth. For, there is nothing more evidently true then the ſaying of <hi>Plato;</hi> that all States are naturally enemies one to another, eſpecially thoſe that are borderers. And this enmity, in our daies, conſiſteth viſibly in thoſe differences of Religion, upon which the neighbour Sovereignties of Chriſtendom are now at diſtance. It is therefore no way imaginable, how all Chriſtian States ſhould concur to make up that <hi>one viſible Church,</hi> whereinto by being baptized, wee obtain the ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal privileges of Chriſtians. But, that it is the profeſſion of the whole Rule of Chriſtianity, that makes any people or State a part of the Viſible Church; being governed by ſuch rules, in the exerciſe of Gods ſervice, as may make it the ſame Society with that, which was once unqueſtionably Gods Church, or part of it. For otherwiſe, how ſhould the Viſible Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one and the ſame, from the firſt to the ſecond coming of our Lord?</p>
            <p>And here you have the ſecond point of our differences. For, all our Sects, under the title of Gods <hi>free grace,</hi> do maintain,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48725:124"/> that the promiſes of the Goſpel, and our right in them, depends not upon the truth of mens Chriſtianity. As if God were not free enough of his Grace, if hee ſhould reſerve himſelf a duty of being ſerved, as by Chriſtians, upon thoſe whom he tenders life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, upon ſuch terms. It is no new thing in <hi>England,</hi> to hear of thoſe who profeſs, that God ſees not, nor can ſee any ſin in his elect. So that, in their opinion, there is no mortal ſin but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; becauſe that muſt ſuppoſe, that a man thought himſelf out of the <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> by the ſin whereof hee repents? I think I am duly informed of a Malefactor dying upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that profeſſed, to the ſtrengthening of his brethern, that hee had overcome all temptation to repentance; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, ſince his being in priſon, hee had been ſtrongly moved to repent. And, that one of <hi>Hackets</hi> three conſpirators, when hee was come to himſelf, continued to profeſs, that hee thought himſelf in the ſtate of Gods Grace all the while. But I will go no further, then the words which I have quoted in another place, out of a Pamphlet written to ſatisfie the God lie. party in <hi>Wales,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended at the late Uſurpers proceedings; which allegeth, that wee are not to bee judged at the laſt day, either by our Works, or by our Faith; but by Gods everlaſting purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning each of us; by virtue whereof Chriſt being alive at the heart, the violation of all his engagements to them, by uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>over them as over others, made no difference in his eſtate towards God. Whoſoever writ this, I think I am duly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that himſelf cauſed it to bee publiſhed. But I am certain, that, to the everlaſting infamie of a Chriſtian Nation, if repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration bee not made, it is ſuppoſed to bee the ſenſe of all the <hi>Godly</hi> in it. And to the ſame effect, my memory aſſures me to have read in one of his ſpeeches; That there are at this day inſpirations of Gods Spirit <hi>beſides the Scriptures,</hi> though not <hi>againſt the Scriptures.</hi> Now certainly, that which a man hath by virtue of the Scriptures; that is, of Chriſtianity; can by no means bee underſtood to bee <hi>beſides the Scriptures.</hi> And certainly, hee that preſumeth upon any motion of Gods Spirit, not ſuppoſing Chriſtianity; that is, not ſuppoſing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; may by the ſame reaſon preſume of his own ſalvation, not ſuppoſing that hee believes and lives as a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The ſame is the conſequence of a Poſition, I will not ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48725:124"/> by any party, but notoriouſly allowed among us; That ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith conſiſteth in believing that a man is one of them that are predeſtinate, whom God ſent our Lord Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, and none elſe. For, how can hee think himſelf obliged to make good the profeſſion of a Chriſtian, who thinks himſelf aſſured of all that hee can attain to by ſo doing, not ſuppoſing it? Indeed it may bee ſaid, that our <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts,</hi> and other Sects among us, (whom no conceit without this could have ſeduced to their ſeveral frenzies,) do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtified from everlaſting, by Gods decree to ſend Chriſt for that purpoſe; whereas this opinion dateth Juſtification from the inſtant that God revealeth the ſaid decree by his Spirit; in which <hi>revelation</hi> they think that juſtifying Faith confiſteth. And certainly, there can bee no reaſon why God, receiving men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grace, only in conſideration of Chriſts obedience, ſhould ſuſpend their reconcilement upon that knowledge of his purpoſe, which hee giveth them by Faith. For what can bee more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, than that God ſhould juſtifie a man, by revealing to him that hee is juſtified? But the opinion is not the leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Chriſtianity, becauſe it is the more unreaſonable. Now it is poſſible, that the effect of this poſition may bee ſtifled, and become void in ſome, by reaſon of other truths which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the ſame indeed, and yet are believed by them, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequence of their own perſwaſions. But thoſe who, beſides this poſition, do pertinaciouſly hold abſolute predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Glory, thoſe, I maintain, are in an errour deſtructive to Chriſtianity, that is, in an <hi>Haereſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And therefore this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being ſuch, it is no way enough, that it is no way injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee taught; but it is requiſite that it bee diſclaimed, by thoſe that pretend to recover the Unity of a Viſible Church. For there can bee no Church, where any thing deſtructive to Chriſtianity, which the being of the Church ſuppoſeth, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly allowed to bee taught.</p>
            <p>Now, between theſe two points of our differences, I am to obſerve a vaſt difference. For, this latter is neceſſary for all Chriſtians to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being the principle of all thoſe actions, which, being juſt for the mater of them, muſt render the men acceptable to God in order to life everlaſting. And therefore, hee that thinketh hee can bee regenerate, or juſtified, or the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48725:125"/> child of God, or indowed with Gods Spirit, not ſuppoſing that hee undertakes and performs the profeſſion of a Chriſtian, renounces the Article of his Creed, concerning <hi>one baptiſme to remiſſion of ſins.</hi> But the being of Gods Viſible Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Unity, which ariſeth upon the agreement of all Chriſtians, to hold Communion in the viſible Offices of Gods ſervice. And therefore, though it bee an Article of our Creed, to believe <hi>one Catholick Church;</hi> yet can it not concern the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every particular Chriſtian, to underſtand the nature of that <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Corporation,</hi> which the bond of this Unity creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Nay, even they who are beſt ſeen in that Government, by which this Unity is preſerved, may well fail in comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſon thereof, by reflecting their diſcourſe upon it. In the mean time, it is neceſſary for all that believe their Creed, to think themſelves tied by this Article, to maintain the Unity of the Church, according to their eſtate; That is, for every ones part, not to bee acceſſory to any Schiſme that diſſolveth it. And therefore, to deny the crime of Schiſme is to deny this Article.</p>
            <p>The conſequence of this obſervation will bee the difference which the Church hath reaſon to uſe, in reconciling parties at diſtance from it, to the Unity thereof; according to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe pretenſes upon which they are at diſtance. For, thoſe who have only diſputed againſt the being of the Church, upon miſunderſtanding the right of Secular Power, which they think the being of the Church inconſiſtent with, ſhall bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reunited to the Church, by conforming to the Law by which the Church is, and was, and may bee eſtabliſhed. For, that there ought to bee proviſion againſt ſuch diſputes for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it concerns not me to give warning. Only, where will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs hath proceeded ſo far in maintaining a falſe poſition, as to make no bones of denying Chriſtianity, and teaching A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, (by obliging to renounce Chriſt, if the Sovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it) it concerneth the Chriſtianity of the Nation to ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made.</p>
            <p>But, where the Haeretical poſitions mentioned afore have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly been maintained; eſpecially, where Congregations have been framed, and uſed, for the exerciſe of Religion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretenſe of them; there will it bee abſolutely neceſſarie, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48725:125"/> they bee expreſly renounced and diſclaimed, either by perſons in particular, or in Body by Congregations. To this head I reduce all <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and Congregations of <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> Thoſe of the fifth <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and Congregations of the fifth <hi>Monarchy; Quakers,</hi> and Congregations of <hi>Quakers.</hi> Nay, all <hi>Independent</hi> Congregations, in my opinion, ought to bee reduced under this meaſure. Not only becauſe their profeſſion is grounded upon the denial of <hi>one viſible Church;</hi> But, becauſe they ſuppoſe themſelves children of God, and indowed with his Spirit, before they bee members of Gods Church; That is, ſetting aſide their Baptiſm, and the Covenant which is ſolemnly inacted by it, between God and each ſoul. And, though I do refer my ſelf to the wiſdom of Superiors, in what form this reconciliation bee ſolemnized; yet, I muſt expreſs my opinion thus far, that there can bee none ſo fit, as that which the wiſdom of the Catholick Church, from the beginning, hath alwaies frequented: By granting them the bleſſing of the Church, with Impoſition of hands, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for their part their ſeveral Sects and Errors; That is, by the praiers of the Church, for the Spirit of God, to reſt upon them, who have barred their baptiſm from giving it, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the peace of the Church, which now they retire unto. For how ſhall the Unity of the Church bee ſecured, but by declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them who violate the ſame accurſed of God?</p>
            <p>Nor let it bee thought, that, our Sectaries of their own accord retiring themſelves unto the Communion of this Church, it will bee requiſite for the Church to admit them, without taking notice of any thing that hath paſſed. For, neither is it to bee preſumed, that they, who have made their own wills their Law for ſo many years, will ſo much as profeſs conformitie to the Rule of the Church; And, if they did profeſs it, there is no reaſon to think that they ſhould ſtand to it; having a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dormant, of the Spirit, to ſtand to their profeſſion, as the intereſt of their faction ſhall require. So, their coming to Church would bee only an advantage for them to infect others. And how ſhould that Communion bee counted a Church, which intertains Haereticks as Haereticks, and Schiſmaticks as Schiſmaticks; that is, without renouncing poſitions deſtructive to the Faith; without obliging themſelves for the future, to hold Unity with the Church? Certainly there is no juſt anſwer for this, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould object it, for the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48725:126"/> reaſon why they refuſe to hold communion with us. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when hee was charged by the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that the Church received their Apoſtates without rebaptizing them, and in their reſpective Orders, could have had no anſwer, if he had not had this; That the Church received them not as <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> but as converted from being <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> they not refuſing to profeſs ſo much.</p>
            <p>Certainly it may bee, and perhaps is juſtifiable for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power, to grant them the exerciſe of their Religion, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate places of their own providing, under ſuch moderate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, as the diſobeying of the Laws of a mans Country might require. For, perſecution to death for that cauſe, the whole Reformation condemneth in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is no reaſon for that, which will not condemn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to baniſhment. But this would require the like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to bee extended to Recuſants of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> True it is, in mine opinion, thoſe Papiſts that think themſelves tied by the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius V.</hi> againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> or, that they may bee tied by the like Acts of his Succeſſors againſt hers; are juſtly liable to the utmoſt of penalties, as profeſſed enemies to their Country. But, beſides that it is manifeſt, that all Papiſts are not of that opinion, which the ſaid <hi>Bull</hi> preſuppoſeth; The State may eaſier be ſecured of Papiſts, againſt all ſuch power in the Pope, then of our Sectaries, againſt that diſpenſation to their Allegiance, which the pretenſe of Gods Spirit may import when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is manifeſt, that many Papiſts hold againſt thoſe equivocations and reſervations, which deſtroy all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Sovereign in his Subjects allegiance; How ſhall a State bee ſecured againſt that infamous falſehood of the late U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, in any man that pretends Gods Spirit upon his terms, which I mentioned afore? Beſides, the Recuſants, being for the moſt part, of the good Families of the Nation, will take it for a part of their Nobility, freely to profeſs themſelves in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they underſtand themſelves; whereas the Sectaries, being people of mean qualitie, for the moſt part, cannot bee preſumed to ſtand upon their reputation ſo much. So, if they cannot bee tolerated in the exerciſe of their Religion, it muſt bee provided, upon what terms they may bee received by the Church. And by that which hath been ſaid, it may appear what my opinion will require of the Presbyterians, for the condition of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48725:126"/> our ſelves into one Church again; Namely, in the firſt place, their ſubmiſſion to the Act, or Decree, or Order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the Sectaries ought to bee tied to renounce the damnable poſitions which they have notoriouſly ſet on foot. For, if they ſhould refuſe this, what reaſon could bee alleged, why they ſhould bee counted Strangers to that infection, which they will not exclude? As for the other Article of the Creed, concerning <hi>one Viſible Church,</hi> it is evident that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that Church, ſuppoſing the Premiſes. For it is evident, that there was a time, when the whole Church was governed by Biſhops; and that not againſt Gods Law, for then there had remained no Church. And therefore, for them to break the Unity of the Church, upon pretenſe of governing this Church by Presbyters, is to break Unity, unleſs a part may give Law to the whole; which who ſo do, are for ſo doing Schiſmaticks. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have due cauſe to caſt us off for Schiſmaticks, if wee ſhould admit this pretenſe. But this is a point, the knowledg whereof cannot belong to the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, for the reaſon alleged before. And therefore, I do not think the Church tied to exact the expreſs profeſſion of it, or the diſclaiming of the error that is oppoſite to it. On the other ſide, the Church, maintaining the Ordinations of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone to bee meer nullities in themſelves, can never own their Ordinations, without renouncing the Catholick Church; yet may it conſent in the perſons, upon their conſent to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſhall bee eſtabliſhed for the future. And indeed, what can they challenge by the meer conſent of certain Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which the Miniſters of Congregations may not pretend to, by the conſent of their reſpective Congregations? And yet, I ſuppoſe, both parties are agreed, not to own them in that Power which the celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> importeth? Let any man, that is capable to judge of ſuch maters, think upon the madneſs of the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Presbyterians without prejudice; Of whom I am duly informed, that they cauſed thoſe, who were ordained only Deacons in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to do the office of Presbyters (which they had no title to) in celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> And tell me what reaſon there can bee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Ordinations of the Congregations, to admit the uſurpations of the Presbyterians. As for the form and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which the conſent of the Church to their Ordinations
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48725:127"/> ſhall bee celebrateed, therein I refer my ſelf to the wiſdom of Superiors; Thinking it would bee a great impertinence in the Presbyterians, if, finding a neceſſity of ſubmitting thoſe whom they have already promoted, to the judgment of the Church, for the condition upon which they are to Miniſter; (which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bt, is the principal) they ſhould inſiſt upon the acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which is the form, and ſolemnity, by which the power is viſibly conveyed. And thus I think the ſecond great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, concerning their Ordinations, may bee compoſed.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuppoſing theſe great difficulties ſet aſide; the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our firſt differences, about the Order of Biſhops, and the Service, cannot ſeem difficult, it the parties bee content to give up their ingagements, to the advantage, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity of the Nation may have by it. For, what reaſonable Chriſtian can think much to acknowledg, that, by reaſon of thoſe partialities, which at length have produced this Schiſme, the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Land are capable of amendment in thoſe two points? On the other ſide, doth not dear experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell all parts, that the change of them by force, though it muſt bee called Reformation, if the Law of the Land call it ſo, yet, is not likely to bee that which it is called? Beſides; conſider the kindneſs which his Majeſties return, and Gods goodneſs, that hath over-ruled mens hearts in it, hath bred in all parties conſenting to it. For, can wee have this before us, and not hope that it will bee enough to ſubdue all prejudices and animoſities, to the intereſt of our common Chriſtianity? Had the peace of the Church never been queſtioned, it might bee charity in a diſcreet Chriſtian, not to call it into queſtion, by propoſing what might bee amended; becauſe the hope of amendment might not countervail the danger of that peace. But, now that Unity is not to bee had, without ſetling of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in maters of difference; to propoſe what may ſeem beſt for the Communitie of Gods Church, in the cure of our breaches, is not to give offenſe, but to take it away.</p>
            <p>I will therefore premiſe here one conſideration, which I mean to aſſume for a ſuppoſition, to ground that which I ſhall propoſe to this purpoſe. It ſhall contain that which I obſerve in the New Teſtament, and the primitive practice Gods Church pointing out the meaning of it, concerning the difference between the <hi>Clergy and People</hi> in all Churches, and the ground of it. For,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48725:127"/> though the edict of our Lord in the Goſpel bee peremptory, that, <hi>who ſo forſaketh not all things, cannot bee my Diſciple;</hi> that is a Chriſtian; (For, they who were other whiles called <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> were called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> as wee read in the <hi>Acts,</hi>) yet common reaſon evinceth, that all Diſciples profeſſed not to forſake the World, (which wee all profeſs to forſake at our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) according to the ſame rate. For, wee ſee by the Goſpel, that the voluntary oblations of thoſe who followed our Lord, miniſtring to him, made a ſtock of money, which <hi>Judas</hi> was truſted with, for charitie to the poor, after that his followers were provided for. But, it is againſt the evidence of common ſenſe to imagine, that all thoſe who profeſſed to follow Chriſt, and to bee his Diſciples, were provided for out of this Stock. It is true, our Lord Promiſeth in the Goſpel, that whoſoever ſhall forſake kindred, or wife, or houſe, or goods, for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhall receive an hundred fold here, and in the World to come life everlaſting. A thing viſibly fullfilled in the primitive ſtate of the Church; when, whoſoever was perſecuted for Chriſtianity, all Chriſtians acknowledged themſelves bound to provide for his ſupport. Neither can it bee ſaid, how S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſaying; that <hi>godlineſs hath the promiſes of this life and of that which is to come;</hi> could bee otherwiſe fullfilled; when thoſe who had undertaken Chriſts Croſs were ſubject to powers, that did, or might perſecute Chriſtianity at their pleaſure. But, though all Chriſtians, in caſe of perſecution, are bound by their Baptiſme, to leave all they have, that they may carry Chriſts Croſs him; Yet it was ſomething more that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> meant when hee ſaid; <hi>Lord wee have left all to follow thee; what ſhall wee have?</hi> For, though a Net and a Fiſher-boat were no great thing to leave; yet, ſo firm a faith as to forſake a mans whole courſe of living, caſting himſelf upon the word of Chriſt for his very being, whether here or in the World to come, is ſutable to the promiſe that follows, of <hi>ſitting upon</hi> XII. <hi>Tbrones to judge the</hi> XII. <hi>Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. The Chriſtians of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> who parted with their Eſtates, that the Diſciples might bee maintained in their daily attendance upon Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, cannot bee ſaid to have obtained thereby any common rank in the Church. But it muſt be ſaid, that, quitting their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe and ſtate of living, by quitting the means of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they became from thenceforth, either of the Clergy, or of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48725:128"/> the poor which were always maintained out of the ſtock of the Church. For, by <hi>S. Pauls</hi> inſtructions to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> V. it appeareth, that thoſe Widows, which were imployed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Church for the common neceſſities of it, were to be taken out of ſuch as were deſtitute of means to live otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Herewith agreeth an infinite number of examples in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, of Godly Biſhops, Prieſts, and others of the Clergy, who, taking upon them ſuch profeſſions, deveſted themſelves of their worldly goods; whether applying them to the property, or only to the uſe of the Church; as reſerving themſelves power to diſpoſe of them, in favour of friends or kindred, at their death. And, from the ſame reaſon and ground proceed all the Canons, whereby it was provided, that they ſhould not diſpoſe of the Church goods to ſuch uſes, at death; but of their own, well and good. For, whatſoever their eſtates were, though they renounced them not, yet, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary for them to live as others of the Clergy lived; who were generally poor when they were promoted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profeſſed to content themſelves with meer neceſſaries, becauſe the Church goods, of which they lived, were due to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the poor, as well as of the Clergy. From whence wee may ſee, what truth there is in thoſe ſayings of the Fathers, which make the precepts of our Lord, in his Sermon upon the mount, maters of Counſel. For, if all Chriſtians bee to leave all things that they may follow Chriſt, it is certain that they are commanded, and not only adviſed, to <hi>turn the other cheek, to quit a mans Coat to him that takes away his Cloak,</hi> to undergo the reſt of thoſe precepts, whereby our Lord deſcribeth the duty of a Chriſtian; provided they bee ſo underſtood, as the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a mans eſtate in the World, and the obligations which it inferreth, even by virtue of that Chriſtianity which alloweth the ſame, will require. But, if there bee another eſtate in the Church, of Diſciples which profeſs of follow Chriſt, leaving the imployment of the world for that purpoſe; and therefore, to forbear the pleaſures and profits thereof according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That ſtrict Rate and that high degree, in which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to leave the world to follow Chriſt, muſt needs bee meer mater of Counſel; becauſe no man is commanded to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that eſtate, but invited to it, for the ſecuring of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who knows hee may be ſaved without it. Whereby it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48725:128"/> appears, that this eſtate imports a profeſſion of abſtinence from the pride, the revenge, the luſts and pleaſures of the world, as well as from the riches of it; as well of the humility, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the continence, the meekneſs and obedience of our Lord, as of the mean eſtate in which hee lived; But that, for the means to compaſs this end, it imports firſt, a profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the rank &amp; eſtate which every man holds in the world: and of dedicating himſelf to the ſervice of the Church, and that imployment which tends to the common good of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould bee inferred from hence, that the ſtate of the Clergy, importing the forſaking of the World, at this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rate, muſt therefore import the profeſſion of ſingle life, as ſome of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it; The anſwer is, that it will not follow. And the inſtance is peremptory; That the Apoſtles themſelves, who thus left the world, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it. And if, by undertaking the Clergy, a man was not obliged to renounce his goods; As appears by thoſe Canons which inable the Clergy to diſpoſe of them at death; much leſs doth that eſtate import a profeſſion of ſingle life; being more difficult to perform, then to live as a Clergy man upon the Church goods. For, it is poſſible for them who have wives, to live as if they had them not, according to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then it is poſſible for them who have the diſpenſing of Church goods, to uſe them as if they uſed them not. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſingle life for the Clergy is firmly grounded, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Canons of the Church, upon the precept of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> forbidding man and wife to part, unleſs for a time, to attend upon Prayer. For, Prieſts and Deacons being continually to attend upon occaſions of celebrating the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which ought continually to be frequented; if others bee to abſtain from the uſe of Marriage for a time, for that purpoſe, then they always. And this is the reaſon, that prevailed ſo far, even in the primitive times, that the inſtances which are produced to the contrary, during thoſe times, ſeem to argue no more then diſpenſation in a Rule, which had the force of a Law, when an exception took not place; That is, when thoſe that were thought neceſſary for the ſervice of the Church, thought not fit to tye themſelves to live ſingle.</p>
            <p>But this profeſſion was evidently the ground for that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which was uſed all over the Church, in breeding youth from tender years, to ſuch a ſtrict courſe of life, as only uſe and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48725:129"/> cuſtom is able to render agreeable to mans nature. And to this education and diſcipline, all the authority and credit of the Clergy over the people is to bee imputed; the diſſolution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is the true occaſion of the miſeries which wee have ſeen. For, did the people think themſelves tyed to depend upon the Clergy for their inſtructions, to admit their admonitions and reproofs in mater of Religion; (that is, did the diſcipline and education of the Clergy maintain them in that authority with the people) it is not poſſible, that the pride which hath been ſeen, in ſetting up new Religions, and giving new Laws to the Church, ſhould take place. But this authority is not to bee preſerved, without retirement from the world; that is, from converſation with the People, of what ranke or degree ſoever, whether upon pretenſe of profit or pleaſure. And therefore, being once loſt, by the debauches of the Clergy before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, it is not to be reſtored, without reſtoring the ground of it, the ſaid education and diſcipline; nor, by conſequence, the Reformation to bee counted compleat otherwiſe; Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing always the Reformation to bee the reſtoring of that Church which hath bee, not the building of that which hath not been. The ſame education and diſcipline is, by the expreſs Canons of the Church, the ground of that title, upon which promotion is due to the Clergy, in their reſpective Churches. For, what is more againſt the Rules of the Church, then to take ſuch men for Prieſts and Biſhops of ſuch Churches, as men know not how they behaved themſelves in lower degrees? Thoſe that talk of the Intereſt of the People in Eccleſiaſtical promotions, without ſuppoſing this ground, do allege nothing but their own dreams, to bring their own dreams to paſs.</p>
            <p>Having this premiſed, I muſt needs ſay, I ſee no manner of inconvenience in that which the Presbyterians pretend for the cheif cauſe of their diſtance; that is, the concurrence of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Biſhops, in Ordinations, and the Juriſdiction of the Church; provided it bee ſetled in that form, which, being grounded upon the Rule of the Catholick Church, may tend to reſtore and advance the common Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Now, I take the Rule of the Church to bee as evidently this, as the common Chriſtianity is evident; that every City, with the Territory thereof, bee the feat and content of a Church. For, though it hath been uſed with ſo much difference in ſeveral parts
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48725:129"/> and times of the Church, that thoſe Countries, which ſome whiles, and ſome where, might have been caſt into four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Churches, have other whiles, and elſewhere, been caſt into four; yet, theſe are but exceptions to a Rule, which, the Law ſaith, do not deſtroy, but confirm it. For, in maters concerning the Whole, the Unity of the Whole, may as well bee preſerved by the concurrence of four, as of fourſcore.</p>
            <p>The Churches, (that is, according to this Rule) the Dioceſes of <hi>England,</hi> have been conſtituted and diſtinguiſhed upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sovereignties, in which, and by conſent whereof, the Chriſtianity of the Nation was firſt planted. Hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders with half an eye, ſhall eaſily ſee, how the converſion of <hi>Kent,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt Angles</hi> and <hi>Mercians,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> produced the foundation of Engliſh Churches. For, of the Britiſh foundations, in the <hi>Weſt</hi> parts of the <hi>Iſland,</hi> from the two Forths to the Lands end, the ſame account is to bee kept; the Dominion of the <hi>Britains</hi> being for ſome time divided into ſeveral Sovereignties. Hee that is convicted of this truth, (which no man can bee convicted of, but hee that conſidereth the caſe; But, who ſo conſidereth the caſe, muſt needs ſtand convict of it) will eaſily grant me, that when the Monarchy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and <hi>England</hi> came to bee divided into Counties, the General Rule of the Church would have required another courſe to have been obſerved. For, had the Head Town of every County been made the Seat of a Church containing that County, no man, that ſurveys the diviſion of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> into Churches (made without the ſecular Power, as before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) will deny; That, the diviſion ſo made would have been more correſpondent to the primitive forme, tending to the Unity of the Whole.</p>
            <p>But, let no man think, that, for the love of ſuch a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, I have any itch to call in queſtion the Unity of the Whole. The alteration is great, and muſt needs produce a great motion, to ingraffe it into the Laws of the Kingdom. And therefore, I am not of opinion to change the Law for hope of amendment, with ſo much appearance of danger, to the being of the Whole. But I am of opinion, that it would bee eaſie to erect Presbyteries; that is, Colleges of Presbyters, in all Shire Towns which have no Cathedral Churches; for the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48725:130"/> Eccleſiaſtical Government of the reſpective Counties, with, and under the Biſhops; And that ſo, the Rule of the Church would bee ſet on work, to the beſt effect and purpoſe. For, thoſe Towns have commonly Churches altogether unprovided of means, through the horrible ſacrileges that have paſſed; and yet, in common reaſon, (agreeing with the wiſdom of Gods Spirit, from whence the Rule of Epiſcopacy iſſued) ought to bee Nurſeries of Chriſtianity to the reſpective Counties. And that intent cannot ſo well bee brought to effect, as by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſeſt, and thoſe that have moſt of the Clergy in their lives, in the moſt eminent places, with authority next to the Chief, over their reſpective bounds. By the miniſtery of ſuch perſons, the Offices of Gods ſervice might ſo bee performed in the chief places, as might be a patern for their Country Churches to follow. Theſe Presbyters might grow up, by education, in that diſcipline of the Clergy, which I have recommended upon the experience of the whole Church. They might live a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate life in common, exerciſing a care and inſpection over In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; together with the charge of inſtructing, or ſeeing them inſtructed in the Scriptures. The Canon of the whole Church, confining all degrees of the Clergy to their reſpective Churches, might bee revived by their means; The ſuperſeding whereof, being certainly one of the irregularities of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hath conduced much to the diſſolution of Diſcipline in the Church. For, in conſcience, how can hee that is obliged to any Church, give account of himſelf to another, to which the firſt is not ſubordinate? And therefore, though the Presbyteries which I propoſe bee not Churches, yet may they take account of their reſpective Clergy, and render it to their Biſhops. The promotion of inferiour Orders, belonging unto their account, may procced upon the account which they give. The cenſures that are requiſite to paſs <hi>in foro exteriori</hi> may paſs them in the firſt inſtance, and from them being tranſmitted to the Biſhop, bee either inacted or voided; Always with right of appeal to the Synod of the Province, in caſes of weight, and in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals thereof, to their Deputies; To which purpoſe, and in which nature, the High Commiſſion ought to bee revived. For, as it is by no means to bee allowed, that the Biſhops negative bee any way queſtioned; So is it no way fit, that the conſent of Biſhop and Presbyters both bee concluded in one and the ſame
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48725:130"/> inſtance. As for thoſe Dioceſes which are concluded within on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one County; there, I ſuppoſe, I need not ſay, that the Chapter of the Cathedral are by inheritance this Presbytery.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe Colleges of Presbyters conſiſting of thoſe only, that ſhall have run the whole courſe of their lives in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcipline of the Clergy; is there any poſſible pretenſe of burthen upon them, if the condition of ſingle life ſhould bee required, to qualifie them for their places? For, this were not to tye any man to ſingle life, ſeeing who will may go forth, and bee provided of a Country Church; But it were to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the diſcipline of the Clergy, in the moſt eminent places, wherein, there is a courſe propoſed to them who imbrace it, of ending their days in it. And the courſe of a Collegiate life, which I propoſe, ſeemeth a ſufficient means and advantage to overcome thoſe temptations, which in theſe days, may ſeem too difficult for all the Clergy to undergo.</p>
            <p>As for the means of ſupporting theſe Presbyteries, wherein the Gure of all Pariſhes within the Shire Towns is provided for, and included; It is no difficulty to him that conſiders with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that originally, the indowment of the Dioceſe was the Patrimony of the Mother Church; and afterwards appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to Pariſh Churches, by abating the right of the Mother Church, upon particular contracts, appearing to bee for the good of the parts. For, if the Mother Church have abated ſo much of her common right, when it was for the good of the Pariſhes; Is it not neceſſary, that the Pariſhes now abate of their property in their reſpective indowments, by Penſions to theſe Colleges, now they appear to bee for the good of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe? And this I am now bold to profeſs, though Superiors do not go before in it, becauſe I am confident, that by this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I abate not a hair of that Power which the Biſhops in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> now uſe; But I adde much to the ſtrictneſs of diſcipline, (that is, in effect, of Chriſtianity) by requiring all Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all acts of Juriſdiction <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> to paſs both the Presbyters and the Biſhop in ſeveral inſtances. And further then this I extend not the opinion of a Divine to particulars; but leave the reſt intire to the wiſdom of Superiors. And this may ſerve to ſhow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is no cauſe why the difference on foot, concerning the Government of the Church, may not ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a change, conducing to the advancement of the common Chriſtianity.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:48725:131"/>
            <p>Which will hold till ſtronger in the other, concerning the Service, if men take their meaſures by the common intereſt of Chriſtianity, not by their particular prejudices. For, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I may well ſuppoſe, that the Sectaries pretenſe of praying by the Spirit, is content to bee buried in oblivion and ſilence; conſidering that the exceſſes are evident, and horrible, which that pretenſe hath brought forth. Beſides, that no man now ſtands to that dangerous poſition; That the Offices of Gods ſervice are of no effect, when they are miniſtred by ſuch as are not in the ſtate of Grace. For, I preſume it is not, nor can bee ſuppoſed on any hand, that all whom the Church muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, are indowed with Gods ſpirit; that is, are in the ſtate of Grace. I ſuppoſe further, as not queſtioned on any hand, that the publick ſervice of God is to conſiſt of the praiſes of God, (by the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and other Hymns of Gods Church) of the reading of the Scriptures, of the inſtruction of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of them; in fine, of the Prayers of the Church, and in the chief place, of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, and thoſe prayers which it is to bee celebrated with.</p>
            <p>Some of our Sects have been bold to pretend, that the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> are impertinent to the Devotions of Chriſtians; as concerning the particular condition of <hi>David,</hi> and compoſed with regard to it. Whereby they overthrow the foundation of Chriſtianity, ſtanding upon this ſuppoſition; that the Old Teſtament is the figure and ſhadow of the New, and that Chriſt hath the key of the writings, as well as of <hi>the houſe of David.</hi> For, ſeeing Chriſt and his myſticall Body the Church are all one, the meaning and intent of the Pſalms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not concern Chriſt, but it muſt end in his Church. But, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church is but ſhadowed in the Pſalms, being part of the Old Teſtament; I can expect no diſpute of the neceſſity of other Hymns, compoſed under Chriſtianity, in the ſolemnizing of Gods publick ſervice. And ſeeing the queſtion on foot concerns the ſetling of the form of Gods ſervice by a Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; there can remain no diſpute concerning the neceſſity of a ſetled Order in reading the Scriptures, and uſing the Pſalms and Hymns of the Church. Nor do I know any man, ſincerely profeſſing the Reformation, that could which not wiſh with all his heart, that the whole order and form to bee ſetled, with the circumſtance of the ſame, might bee according to the primitive
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48725:131"/> ſimplicity, and naked plainneſs of the antient Church; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the difference between the ſtate in which the Church lived under perſecution, and now, that, being protected by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, it receiveth all the World to take part in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. For, what difference this will infer in the Order and Rule of Gods ſervice, to bee inacted by a Law of this Kingdom, common reaſon, and the perpetual practiſe of Gods Church, together with the precedents recorded in Scripture, muſt bee admitted to Witneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſuppoſed, no man doubts, that the form of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now in force by the Law of this Land, may bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged capable of amendment, without diſparagement, either to the wiſdom of the Church, that preſcribed, or of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that inacted it. For, what poſitive Law of man is there that is not? Nay, what arrogance can it bee in a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (having beſtowed more conſideration upon it, then it is poſſible, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e who had the framing of it ſhould have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do) to think that hee knows ſome particulars, in which it might bee mended? For, neither doth it follow, that it is better to endanger the ſpoyling of it by calling it in queſtion, then to let it reſt as it is: And that particular perſon, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee is, that ſhould think his own opinion neceſſary to bee followed, without compromiſing it to the publick, would juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incur the mark of arrogance. Since therefore, that this is the time for ſuch a debate, if any change bee pretended; and that the reaſons mentioned afore, are of ſufficient conſideration to oblige all ſides, to prefer unity before prejudice; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that, either it bee left intire in that State wherein it ſtands, or that nothing bee changed, without ſufficient debate of reaſon upon the whole, what is fit to bee changed, what not?</p>
            <p>But one thing I muſt here expreſly ſtand upon, becauſe the form of Gods ſervice which hath been uſurped during the Schiſme, proteſteth againſt the Law in force. I acknowledge, that the whole Reformation proteſteth againſt the inſufficience and defects of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the courſe which it taketh for the inſtruction of Chriſtian people, in the duties of their Chriſtianity; againſt the abuſes there practiſed, in celebrating the Euchariſt without any pretenſe of a Communion, in private Maſſes: and in ſerving God in a Language which the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not. For, theſe abuſes are a principal part of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48725:132"/> ground for that change, which wee juſtly maintain to bee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; The boldneſs of thoſe that oppoſed it, being come to ſuch a height, as openly to maintain, that it concerneth not Chriſtian people to know, or to mind what is done at the Maſs, (being the ordinary ſervice of God, for which they come to Church,) or what is ſaid; But, that the intention of the Prieſt is enough to apply the ſacrifice of Chriſt to all that are preſent, (which they think it doth no leſs to them that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and therefore leave us unſatisfied why people ſhould come to Church) who need do nothing but ſay their <hi>Paters</hi> and their <hi>Aves.</hi> Theſe abuſes I do acknowledge. But, bee the World my witneſs, and all that know what hath paſſed, for the mater of Religion, in the World; was it ever proteſted, by thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Reformation in the Church, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ought to bee celebrated but four times or twelve times in the year? That by Gods Law, there ought to bee two Sermons every Sunday in every Church? That other Feſtivals beſide the Sunday, and ſet times of Faſting ought not to bee ſolemnized with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God? That the Church doors ought not to bee open, but when there is preaching? Take the primitive practice of the Church along with the Scripture, and they ſhall tell you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tale; that Prayer, and the praiſes of God, is the more principal end of Chriſtian Aſſemblies, then Preaching. The reaſon is unanſwerable; For, the one is the end, the other the means. That the celebration of the Euchariſt is the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Office of Gods ſervice under Chriſtianity, is no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For, other Offices are common to Judaiſme; this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting moſt in Prayers, conſiſts of thoſe Prayers which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Chriſtianity; that is, to thoſe cauſes wherein our Salvation conſiſteth. And can there bee queſtion how frequent it ought to bee? Shall not the practice of the whole Church, from the beginning, decide the queſtion, if any remain? The ſingle life of the Clergy prevailed for this end, that they might bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to celebrate the Euchariſt; ſay the Fathers, and the Canons, which I alleged afore. It is a queſtion in <hi>Gennadius de dogmatibus Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> whether every man ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate every day or not. But therefore no queſtion, that it ought to bee celebrated every day, that who ſo would might communicate. In conſcience, would they bee bound to Preach every day, that are ſo much for Preaching? After the reading
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48725:132"/> of the Scripture, follows the Sermon, and after that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; This is the primitive order of the whole Church, at that ſolemn ſervice, when the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Euchariſt (on Faſting-days in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, on other days before Noon) was Celebrated. After the Scriptures were read, the people were taught their duty out of them. A thing neceſſary and poſſible. Not that every Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſhould bee bound to declame by the Glaſs; But, that hee ſhould bee bound to inſtruct his Pariſh out of the Scriptures which are read: If hee bee tyed to Preach as often as the Church door opens, the Church door muſt bee ſhut; becauſe no ſides can hold out, ſo oft as Chriſtians ought to meet for Gods ſervice. I call the World to witneſs; Is it not as much a work of lungs and ſides, as an Office of Gods ſervice, which takes up the time of their Church Aſſemblies? Is not the way opened, by this means, to declame of publick Government in Church and State, to intertain the Hearers? For alas, ſhould men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves to that which the generality of their audience might edifie by, in their Chriſtianity, the Trade would bee obſtructed.</p>
            <p>For, let mee freely ſay, the undoubted truth of the common Chriſtianity, (which no Sermons ought to exceed, becauſe they pretend the edification of the generality of Chriſtians) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſo narrow a compaſs, that no eloquence (much leſs, the eloquence of all that muſt come into the Pulpit) can change the ſeaſoning and ſerving of it, ſo as to make it agreeable to mens palats; without fetching in mater impertinent, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the common Chriſtianity. And the ſame is, for more peremptory reaſon, to bee ſaid of arbitrary Prayers. For, the very poſture of him, that pretendeth to prefer the devotions of Gods people to the Altar which is above, ſtrongly impreſſeth upon the hearts of ſimple Chriſtians, an opinion, that thereby they diſcharge to God the duty which hee requires at their hands. Which, if the mater of thoſe Prayers be ſuch as the common Chriſtianity requires, they may do indeed. But, if it be poſſible, that Rebellion, Slander, Nonſenſe and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may bee the mater of them, as well as Chriſtianity, then is it not Religion, but Superſtition which ſuch devotions exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe: Nor, can that Kingdom ſtand excuſed to God, which ſhall gratifie that licentiouſneſs, whereof they ſee the effect before their eyes. All reaſon of Chriſtianity concurres with the practiſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48725:133"/> of the whole Church, to witneſs; that the intereſt of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity requires the ſervice of God to bee maintained and exerciſed daily, (yea hourly, were it poſſible) not only by particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but by Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, ſo far as the buſineſs of the World will give leave, and as there is means to maintain mens attendance upon it. There may come abuſe in the order, the form, the mater of that which is tendred to God for his Service. But, in ſtead of reforming thoſe abuſes, to take away the means, the Rule, the obligation of ſuch meetings, is meer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in deſtroying, (under pretenſe of Reforming) Gods Church.</p>
            <p>And, though I charge no ſuch deſign upon thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the obligation of the Sabbath to conſiſt in two Sermons; yet I do maintain, it is manifeſt to common reaſon, that the form which that opinion introduceth neceſſarily tends to that effect. Strange it is, that a Nation capable of ſenſe, in an age improved by learning, ſhould bee intangled with the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo vain an imagination; that God by the ſame fourth Commandment, ſhould oblige both Jews to keep the Saturday, and Chriſtians the Sunday; Eſpecially, no man daring to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that both were, or are tyed to the ſame meaſure of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore, though, (rather then croſs the ſtream of ſuch a ſuperſtition; For, let no man think, that all ſuperſtition can bee ſhut out of Gods Church) there may bee reaſon to live conformable to the Rules which ſuch ſuperſtition produceth; Yet, provided that the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of <hi>England,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Laws of the Whole Church, bee not abated, ſo as to ſtick an evident mark of Schiſme upon the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For, the Law that is recommending the celebration of the Euchariſt, upon all Sundays and Feſtivals; but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Service to bee uſed, as well on Feſtivals and Faſting days, as upon Sundays, (beſides the week days) at the publick Aſſemblies of reſpective Congregations; To change this Order for two Sermons on the Sunday alone, what is it but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the whole Church, for the love of thoſe that have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon cauſes common to it with the whole Church?</p>
            <p>They that would have the Reformation of the Church to bee indeed, that which the Law of the Land calleth it, ſhould firſt provide a courſe to bee eſtabliſhed for Law, by which, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſouls, (who have equal intereſt in the commonſalvation)
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48725:133"/> might ſerve God in publick, all Sundays and Feſtivals. For, ſeeing there was a courſe in Law, before the Reformation, for all ſervants, as well as others, to bee at Maſs all Sundays and Feſtivals; And the Church was inabled to require account of it at their hands; It will not bee Reformation to abrogate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of the Maſs, till a courſe bee taken, that all Chriſtians may frequent that, which ſhall appear to bee indeed the ſervice of God inſtead of the Maſs. Let no Preachers flatter themſelves with an opinion, that they ſhall ever make Chriſtians ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jews, as to perſwade them to dreſs no meat on the Sundays. If Servants muſt ſtay at home to dreſs meat on Sundays, (and for other occaſions they muſt ſtay at home, beſides that) will not the way to repair that breach, bee to injoyn ſeveral Aſſemblies in all Pariſh Churches, upon all Sunday mornings; that ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſons, of ſeveral Eſtates and qualities, may have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to attend the publick ſervice of God, at ſeveral hours of the ſame Sundays and Holy-days? For, though I underſtand very well, that this would impoſe upon the Church, (that is, upon my brethren of the Clergy,) a greater burthen, than an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons meal of a Sermon; (which all men know, is furniſhed of the cold meat of the forenoon) yet, it is neceſſary that the World ſhould bee cleared of this impoſture that reigneth; that two Sermons every Sunday, is the due way of keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath among Chriſtians, or of advancing Gods publick ſervice.</p>
            <p>I will not here diſpute, that the Lent-Faſt was inſtituted by the Apoſtles. But this I maintain to bee evident, that the Faſt afore the Reſurrection of Chriſt is and was as antient as the Feaſt of his Reſurrection; and that more antient then the keeping of all Lords days in the year, being meerly the reflection of that one, all the weeks of the year. Nor will any man, that knows what hee ſays, ever queſtion, that the inlarging of it to forty days is a juſt Law, voluntarily undertaken by the Whole Church, not to bee condemned without the like mark of Schiſme. For, ſince the World is come into the Church, is there not manifeſt reaſon, that more time ſhould bee taken, for the expiating of more ſins, which are the ſins of more people? to prepare, as well the Elder, to renew their Chriſtianity by communicating at <hi>Eaſter;</hi> as the younger to bee confirmed, and come firſt to the Communion at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> now they are baptized Infants?

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48725:134"/> As for the <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> if wee ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, unleſs our Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees; And, if it bee evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as evident it is, that the Scribes and Phariſees preſcribed <hi>Mundays</hi> and <hi>Thurſdays</hi> for days of leſs ſolemn Aſſemblies then the Sabbath; How ſhall wee enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, if in deſpite of the whole Church, which hath hitherto uſed <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> in lieu of <hi>Mundays</hi> and <hi>Thurſdays,</hi> uſed by the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> wee void the Law of <hi>England</hi> by which they are in force? Of the Ceremonies the ſame is to bee underſtood; Not becauſe it can bee within the compaſs of common reaſon to imagine, that the ſame Ceremonies have continued, from the time that the Church was perſecuted into holes and caves of the Earth, to this time, in which the queſtion is of ſetling Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by the Law of this Kingdom. It were want of common underſtanding to think that the ſame could ſerve. But, becauſe ſo few, and ſo innocent as wee uſe, cannot bee condemned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemning, not only Gods whole Church, but alſo Gods antient people; who will evidently bee found in the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>One thing hath been caſt forth in barre to all this, which wee muſt not ſwallow whole, unleſs wee mean to impoſe upon our ſelves. It is the pretenſe of complying with the Reformed Churches. For, it is evident, that there are four forms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation extant; One according to <hi>Luther,</hi> another accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Calvine,</hi> the third is, that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in the laſt place, (though firſt for time, becauſe leaſt known, and protected by no Sovereign) I name that the Union in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</hi> For, wee are to know, that the followers of <hi>John Huſſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent Deputies to the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> they accorded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the Nation upon four Articles; The chief whereof was the Communion in both kinds. They that ſtood to the accord, are to this day called thereupon <hi>Calixtini,</hi> or <hi>ſub utraque,</hi> in Latine. But another part of thoſe that were at diſtance, thinking themſelves betrayed by their Deputies in that accord, proceeded to ſettle themſelves in a form of Religion, and the ſervice of God, by that which they held the pure truth of God, in all points that had been diſputed. The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> 1. King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> having ſubdued his ſubjects there, that roſe with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi> caſt a good part of theſe out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; who, finding ſhelter in <hi>Polonia;</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> there planted
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48725:134"/> and propagated their form, till the troubles of our time; when, by the Emperours victory in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the late troubles in <hi>Poland,</hi> they ſeem to bee at a low ebbe, though they impute it to the decay of their firſt diſcipline.</p>
            <p>They that would reform the Church of <hi>England,</hi> profeſſing already that Reformation which it found beſt, will they not firſt ſhow us reaſon, why wee are to leave <hi>Luther</hi> for <hi>Calvine?</hi> For, if they mean his form, when they talk of conforming us to the reformed Churches, becauſe of the Scots Presbyteries, they muſt have better arguments, then either the learning or the Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Scottiſh Presbyterians will yield, to perſwade us. They ſay, thoſe that framed the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> being bred under <hi>Melancthon</hi> among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> followed them much an end in the order and form which they preſcribed. But is that any reaſon for any change, before it appear which is in the right? I freely profeſs I find <hi>Melancthon</hi> the better learned, and the more Chriſtian ſpirit. But the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which in divers points differeth from both, why ſhould it bee thought to follow either, for any reaſon, but, as either agrees with the Catholick Church? And for that I prefer the Unity of <hi>Bohemia</hi> before both; For, they had the rule of <hi>Vincentius</hi> given them, to take their meaſure by the conſent of the Catholick Church, and thoſe things which have always and every where been profeſſed and practiſed in it: And, had they done nothing but what is juſtifiable by that Rule, I ſhould not blame them for that which I blame in them moſt. But where they agree not with <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvine,</hi> wherein do they not agree with the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In particular, they ſent all over the World, to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a viſible ſucceſſion of Biſhops, whoſe profeſſion was ſuch, that they might derive the Ordination of Biſhops, for their Churches, from their hands. They took the ſuperſtitions of the Greeks to bee ſuch, that they could not own it from them. In that think they were in the wrong. For, I doubt not, the Greeks would have granted them Ordination only under the profeſſion of the Catholick Church; and that had been enough. But, thinking themſelves in a ſtrait of neceſſity, they choſe twelve by lots; And hearing that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> lived in <hi>Auſtria</hi> under Biſhops, deriving their ſucceſſion from the time of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> (and therefore from the Apoſtles) they ſent them thither to bee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48725:135"/> Ordained, proteſting againſt their weakneſs, in going to Maſs for fear. The proteſtation was admitted, and the perſons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Biſhops. Now, I take not upon me to maintain the truth of that information, concerning the ſucceſſion of theſe Biſhops, whereupon they proceeded. But, they being reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably perſwaded of it, and not knowing how to proceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (through a miſtake or an exigent, which they could not overcome) and ſetling themſelves upon an innocent preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; why ſhould the effect of theſe Ordinations ſeem queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? For, under theſe Biſhops they have ſubſiſted from that day to this.</p>
            <p>And, with what conſcience is it demanded, for conformity to the Reformation, that wee acknowledge them Prieſts who are ordained againſt Biſhops? If wee do not, wee ſhall condemn thoſe Reformed Churches, which have no Biſhops. Is it the faſhion, that a man quit his cloke, becauſe his fellow hath none? Or is it any thing elſe, to renounce a good Title, becauſe they cannot plead it? There was a good expedient in the antient Church, to refer things to God, which could not bee decided without a breach in the Church. Let their zeal againſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bee counted pardonable with God, which cauſed them to think the Order of Biſhops a ſupport of Antichriſt; when as the Papacy is viſibly raiſed upon the rights of Biſhops which it ingroſſeth. Let the difficulty of procuring Ordinations, and having Biſhops, render them excuſable to God. Thoſe that are ordained by Presbyters againſt Biſhops, on purpoſe to ſet up Altar againſt Altar, how can wee count them ordained, refuſing the concurrence of the Church to their Ordinations? They that would tye us to comply with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, are firſt to ſhow us, that the Unity of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is no part of it; And, that their Reformation is not to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either before that of <hi>Luther,</hi> or that of <hi>Calvine.</hi> For, can wee acknowledge the Ordinations of Presbyters againſt their Biſhops, and not condemn them, that ſought all over the World for Biſhops to ordain them Biſhops, that the Biſhops ſo ordained might ordain them Presbyters?</p>
            <p>But, not only in this prime point of our differences, but alſo in the difference of the Clergy from the people, in the three Orders, of Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Juſtification and the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> of Confirmation, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48725:135"/> Penance, of the Feſtivals and Faſts of the Church, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Orders and inſtitutions of leſs conſequence, their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreeth with the antient Church, and the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where it departeth from both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvine.</hi> In the mater of Penance (though with much humility) they tell the <hi>Lutherans</hi> roundly, they have but one of the Keyes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of looſing, but bind not; as pronouncing abſolution without injoyning of Penance. The diſcipline of <hi>Geneva</hi> they magnifie indeed, as they find it deſcribed by <hi>Bodine,</hi> in his method of Hiſtories; But they diſtinguiſh not, whether they mean the civil diſcipline, which the Laws of that State inforce, or that which the Power of the Keys, exerciſed there according to <hi>Calvine,</hi> doth conſtitute. For, the Civil Law of a Chriſtian State (eſpecially, no bigger then that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>) may ſettle ſuch a diſcipline over the outward man, as may reſtrain from the outward act of ſin, without mortifying the inward man to the inward love of God. The late Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Army wee have ſeen well diſciplined, againſt the ordinary vices of the Camp; Who, appearing now to have been then enemies to their Country, are thereby diſcovered not to have followed the reward of Chriſtiens, but of Souldiers. And the Laws of Chriſtian States, by the means of Chriſtianity which they maintain, may reach to the mortifying of ſin, and the quickning of righteouſneſs at the heart; But of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being Civil Laws, and propoſing no further reward or puniſhment, then that good which a mans Country ſignifies, they reach no further then the outward man, for the better or for the worſe. Nor is it of any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greater conſequence to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that the outward act of ſin or virtue is repreſſed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, by the rewards and penalties of Civil Laws. But, when the diſcipline of the Church takes place, hee who forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Chriſtianity by groſs ſin that is notorious, forfeiteth alſo Communion with the Church; and recovereth it not, till the preſumption bee no leſs notorious, that hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Chriſtianity. Now, Communion with the Church is the conſequence of our Baptiſme, which intitleth us to life everlaſting. Therefore it is not duly forfeited, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the effect of Baptiſme, our right to life everlaſting. So, our right to heaven depending upon the Communion of the Church; the diſcipline of the Church muſt needs reach the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48725:136"/> inward man as effectually, as any outward application can reach the heart, which is inviſible. For, the preſumption is grounded upon viſible works of Penance; the effects of that inviſible diſpoſition; without which they could not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought forth. Whether or no this diſcipline bee viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>Geneva;</hi> I will not pronounce. This I undertake, that, comparing the Doctrine of <hi>Calvine</hi> with their Orders; they need not ſet a value upon the Power of the Keys exerciſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Doctrine, in compariſon of the ſame exerciſed according to their own Orders. So that ſuppoſing, not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Laws of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (being the Laws of the primitive Catholick Church) are to bee changed for conformity with the Reformed Churches; it followeth not therefore, that they are to bee changed, for thoſe of the Churches reformed according to <hi>Calvine.</hi> Certainly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Communion kneeling having been one of the Orders of their Reformation from the beginning, and ſo ſtifly inſiſted upon by them in <hi>Poland;</hi> they that pretend to change the Law of <hi>England</hi> in that point, for conformity with the Reformation, think they have not men but beaſts to deal with.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Commination againſt ſinners,</hi> hath declared a great zeal for the renewing of that antient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Penance, which was in force in the primitive Church. And certainly, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not the Church of <hi>England</hi> but in Name, till the power of Excommunication bee reſtored unto it, which there was not, nor ever can bee ſufficient cauſe to take from any Church. But, the diſcipline of Penance, though depending upon the Power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, is as much to bee preferred b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ore it, as it is more deſirable to bring men to the Church, then to ſhut them out of it. If prejudice and faction have not more to do in the pretenſes of this time, then the truth of Chriſtianity, and zeal to advance it; it is a point that cannot bee neglected in any deliberation of Reforming the Church. I cannot render a more viſible reaſon, why ſo godly a zeal, in thoſe that firſt preſcribed our Reformation, to the reſtoring of Penance, hath not been improved by their ſucceſſors; then the partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſprung up in it like tares in the wheat, and have now prevailed to choke even the power of Excommunication, wherein the being of a Church conſiſteth. And though many
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48725:136"/> ſinnes of this Nation may bee alleged, for the cauſe why God hath taken this ſharp revenge upon us; yet can no reaſon bee ſo proper, why hee ſhould permit the hedge of the Church to bee caſt down, (for all Sects to devour, and tread his Vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard under foot) by ſuffering the power of Excommunication to bee taken from it; as the neglect of improving it, in and to the diſcipline of Penance. True it is, not only all capital, but all infamous crimes, whereof men are convicted by Law, are thereby notorious, and require this diſcipline, no leſs then thoſe which the Law of this Land puniſheth not otherwiſe then by Penance. And if the Church did make a difference among thoſe that dye by publick Juſtice; owning only thoſe, who approve their deſire to undergo regular Penance, in caſe they might ſurvive; then were this diſcipline viſible, no viſible crime eſcaping it. For, all capitall and infamous crimes, that are not actually puniſhed with death, muſt by that reaſon remain unreconciled to the Church; though free of the Law; till Penance bee done. And ſeeing crimes that are not known cannot bee cured upon eaſier terms then thoſe that are; would not the judgement of the Law, authorizing the Church in the cure of known ſins, move even them that believe their Chriſtianity, no further then it is authorized by Law, to ſubmit inviſible ſinnes to the ſame cure? For, what is it, but the ſlighting of this cure, that makes mens ſinnes feſter and rankle inwardly, and break out into greater and greater exceſſes? And therefore, to debate of Ceremonies, and words in the ſervice, and May-poles, and Sabbath days journeyes, not conſidering the Power of the Keyes, upon which the Church is founded, and the reſtoring of the ſame; is to neglect a conſumption at the heart, pretending only to cure the hair, or the nails.</p>
            <p>Now if any of our Sects inſiſt upon a pretenſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to bee inſiſted upon, far bee it from us to caſt off the conſideration of it, becauſe they have unduely ſeparated from the Church for it. Our <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> it is known, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſt upon two points; The baptizing of Infants; and that, by ſprinkling, not by dipping. In both, they have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed St. <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine; That <hi>Baptiſme ſaveth us, not the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide of the filth of our fleſh, but the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to God.</hi> For, were the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated

               </gap>nt of Baptiſme, believed to bee that which ſaveth us, men would not go to baptize them, as not baptized, who by their profeſſion (which they acknowledge by ſeeking the Communion of the Church) are under that bond, which intitleth them to the Salvation of Chriſtians. Nor can there bee any greater preſumption, then the voiding of Baptiſme ſo celebrated, that they expect Salvation upon other terms. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, in making void Baptiſme miniſtred by ſprinkling alone, without dipping, they neglect St. <hi>Peter</hi> again; when hee maketh the Baptiſme that ſaveth not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in cleanſing the fleſh, but in a due profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſignifying this to bee the principal, that onely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory Ceremony, which it is ſolemnized with. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are to acknowledge this difference, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Baptiſme ſo miniſtred to bee good and valid, not void. But, this being acknowledged, well may they inſiſt, that it is unduely miniſtred. For it is evident, that, neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Scripture, nor the practiſe of the whole Church, can by any means allow the ſprinkling of water for Baptiſme; though the pouring on of water, in caſe of neceſſity, bee allowed. Nor doth the Law of the Church of <hi>England</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any more then <hi>pouring water upon a Child that is weak,</hi> commanding therefore <hi>dipping</hi> otherwiſe. And therefore this Law, being much weakned by the tenderneſs of Mothers and Friends, (ſuppoſing all Infants weak, which the Law ſuppoſeth not) and by undue zeal for Forreign Faſhions, ought to bee revived and brought into uſe by all Ordinaries, that there may remain no colour for ſuch an offenſe. And therefore, reparation is to bee made for the ſacrilege of the late Wars, in deſtroying the Fonts of Baptiſme in Churches, and bringing in Chriſtening out of <hi>Baſins</hi> by force.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay that I have touched all that is fit to bee touched. But I hope I have ſaid nothing, but that which followeth upon the ground, which I have juſtified. That which is propoſed, and is not ſo juſtified, ſeems to demand the conſent of thoſe who propoſe it, as able to hold the Church divided, if they bee not contented; But that calls to mind a reaſon on the other ſide, that men uſe to get a ſtomack with eating, in ſuch caſes. The due meaſure is not the ſatisfying of mens appetites, but the improvement of our common Chriſtianity.</p>
